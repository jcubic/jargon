    <def> Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter &#8216;O&#8217; (the 15th
   letter of the English alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they look a lot
   alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually distinct have
   compounded the confusion.  If your zero is center-dotted and letter-O is
   not, or if letter-O looks almost rectangular but zero looks more like an
   American football stood on end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at
   a modern character display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated
   as an option on IBM 3270 controllers).  If your zero is slashed but
   letter-O is not, you're probably looking at an old-style ASCII graphic set
   descended from the default typewheel on the venerable ASR-33 Teletype
   (Scandinavians, for whom Ø is a letter, curse this arrangement).
   (Interestingly, the slashed zero long predates computers; Florian Cajori's
   monumental A History of Mathematical Notations notes
   that it was used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.) If letter-O has
   a slash across it and the zero does not, your display is tuned for a very
   old convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers
   (Scandinavians curse <emphasis>this</emphasis> arrangement even more,
   because it means two of their letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys
   equipment displays a zero with a <emphasis>reversed</emphasis> slash. Old
   CDC computers rendered letter O as an unbroken oval and 0 as an oval broken
   at upper right and lower left.  And yet another convention common on early
   line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the
   letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O
   (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how to draw ASCII
   characters, but the final standard changed the distinguisher to a tick-mark
   in the upper-left corner).  Are we sufficiently confused yet?</def>

   <emphasis>register</emphasis> is a fairly reliable
   indication that the user has been around for quite a while and/or that the
   architecture under discussion is quite old.  The term in full is almost
   never used of microprocessor registers, for example, though symbolic names

   Adventure or Colossal Cave Adventure, but the
   <name>TOPS-10</name> operating system permitted only six-letter
   filenames in uppercase.  See also <name>vadding</name>,
   <name>Zork</name>, and <name>Infocom</name>.This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in

   happen that the storage is freed or reallocated (and thus moved) through
   one alias and then referenced through another, which may lead to subtle
   (and possibly intermittent) lossage depending on the state and the
   allocation history of the malloc <name>arena</name>.  Avoidable
   by use of allocation strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use
   of higher-level languages, such as <name>LISP</name>, which
   employ a garbage collector (see <name>GC</name>).  Also called a

    <def> The archetypal individuals used as examples in discussions of
   cryptographic protocols.  Originally, theorists would say something like:
   <italic>A communicates with someone who claims to be B, So to be sure, A
   tests that B knows a secret number K. So A sends to B a random number X. B
   then forms Y by encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to A</italic>
   Because this sort of thing is quite hard to follow, theorists stopped using
   the unadorned letters A and B to represent the main players and started
   calling them Alice and Bob. So now we say <italic>Alice communicates with
   someone claiming to be Bob, and to be sure, Alice tests that Bob knows a
   secret number K. Alice sends to Bob a random number X. Bob then forms Y by
   encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to Alice</italic>.  A whole
   mythology rapidly grew up around the metasyntactic names; see http://www.conceptlabs.co.uk/alicebob.html.In Bruce Schneier's definitive introductory text Applied
   Cryptography (2nd ed., 1996, John Wiley &amp; Sons, ISBN
   0-471-11709-9) he introduced a table of dramatis personae headed by Alice
   and Bob.  Others include Carol (a participant in three- and four-party
   protocols), Dave (a participant in four-party protocols), Eve (an
   eavesdropper), Mallory (a malicious active attacker), Trent (a trusted
   arbitrator), Walter (a warden), Peggy (a prover) and Victor (a verifier).
   These names for roles are either already standard or, given the wide
   popularity of the book, may be expected to quickly become so.</def>

    <term>all your base are belong to us</term>
    <def> A declaration of victory or superiority. The phrase stems from a
   1991 adaptation of Toaplan's <italic>Zero Wing</italic> shoot-'em-up arcade
   game for the Sega Genesis game console. A brief introduction was added to
   the opening screen, and it has what many consider to be the worst
   Japanese-to-English translation in video game history. The introduction
   shows the bridge of a starship in chaos as a Borg-like figure named CATS
   materializes and says, <italic>How are you gentlemen!!  All your base are
   belong to us.</italic> [sic] In 2001, this amusing mistranslation spread
   virally through the Internet, bringing with it a slew of JPEGs and a movie
   of hacked photographs, each showing a street sign, store front, package
   label, etc. hacked to read <italic>All your base are belong to us</italic> or
   one of the other many supremely dopey lines from the game (such as
   <italic>Somebody set up usthe bomb!!!</italic> or <italic>What
   happen?</italic>). When these phrases are used properly, the overall effect
   is both screamingly funny and somewhat chilling, reminiscent of the B movie
   <italic>They Live</italic>.The original has been generalized to <italic>All your X are belong to
   us</italic>, where X is filled in to connote a sinister takeover of some
   sort.  Thus, <italic>When Joe signed up for his new job at Yoyodyne, he had

    <def> A series of personal computer models originally sold by Commodore,
   based on 680x0 processors, custom support chips and an operating system
   that combined some of the best features of Macintosh and Unix with
   compatibility with neither.The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world
   standardized on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining serious
   market share, despite the fact that the first Amigas had a substantial
   technological lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead, it acquired a small
   but zealous population of enthusiastic hackers who dreamt of one day
   unseating the clones (see <name>Amiga Persecution Complex</name>).
   The traits of this culture are both spoofed and
   illuminated in  The BLAZE Humor
   Viewer. The strength of the Amiga platform seeded a small industry
   of companies building software and hardware for the platform, especially in
   graphics and video applications (see <name>video toaster</name>).
   Due to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&amp;D,
   allowing the competition to close Amiga's technological lead.  After
   Commodore went bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through several
   hands, none of whom did much with it.  However, the Amiga is still being
   produced in Europe under license and has a substantial number of fans,
   which will probably extend the platform's life considerably.</def>

   messages including <italic>An error has occurred because an error of type 42

   anonymous-posting sites.  Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for
   anonymous postings triggered on its own automatically-generated control

   some other headers of its parent.  This produced a flood of messages in

   line got longer and longer and longer.Reactions varied from amusement to outrage.  The pathological

    <def> [originally an acronym (American Standard Code for Information
   Interchange) but now merely conventional] The predominant character set
   encoding of present-day computers.  The standard version uses 7 bits for
   each character, whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts of ASCII
   prior to June 1961) used fewer.  This change allowed the inclusion of
   lowercase letters &#8212; a major <name>win</name> &#8212; but it
   did not provide for accented letters or any other letterforms not used in
   English (such as the German sharp-S ß. or the ae-ligature æ
   which is a letter in, for example, Norwegian).  It could be worse, though.
   It could be much worse.  See <name>EBCDIC</name> to understand
   how.  A history of ASCII and its ancestors is at http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html.Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than
   humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about
   characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal shorthand
   for them.  Every character has one or more names &#8212; some formal, some
   concise, some silly.  Common jargon names for ASCII characters are
   collected here.  See also individual entries for
   <name>bang</name>, <name>excl</name>,
   <name>open</name>, <name>ques</name>,
   <name>semi</name>, <name>shriek</name>,
   <name>splat</name>, <name>twiddle</name>, and
   <name>Yu-Shiang Whole Fish</name>.This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII pronunciation
   guide.  Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character pairs are
   sorted in by first member.  For each character, common names are given in
   rough order of popularity, followed by names that are reported but rarely
   seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by brokets: &lt;&gt;.
   Square brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by
   <name>INTERCAL</name>.  The abbreviations <italic>l/r</italic> and
   <italic>o/c</italic> stand for left/right and <italic>open/close</italic>
   respectively.  Ordinary parentheticals provide some usage
   information.The pronunciation of # as &#8216;pound&#8217; is
   common in the U.S.  but a bad idea; 
   <name>Commonwealth Hackish</name> 
   has its own, rather more apposite use of &#8216;pound
   sign&#8217; (confusingly, on British keyboards the £ happens to
   replace #; thus Britishers sometimes call
   # on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard &#8216;pound&#8217;,
   compounding the American error).  The U.S. usage derives from an
   old-fashioned commercial practice of using a # suffix to
   tag pound weights on bills of lading.  The character is usually pronounced
   &#8216;hash&#8217; outside the U.S.  There are more culture wars over the
   correct pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to
   the <name>ha ha only serious</name> suggestion that it be
   pronounced <italic>shibboleth</italic> (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or
   Tanakh).The &#8216;uparrow&#8217; name for circumflex and
   &#8216;leftarrow&#8217; name for underline are historical relics from
   archaic ASCII (the 1963 version), which had these graphics in those
   character positions rather than the modern punctuation characters.The &#8216;swung dash&#8217; or &#8216;approximation&#8217; sign
   (&#8764;) is not quite the same as tilde ~ in typeset material, but the ASCII
   tilde serves for both (compare <name>angle brackets</name>).
   Some other common usages cause odd overlaps.  The
   #, $, &gt;, and
   &amp; characters, for example, are all pronounced
   <italic>hex</italic> in different communities because various assemblers use
   them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in particular,
   # in many assembler-programming cultures,
   $ in the 6502 world, &gt; at Texas
   Instruments, and &amp; on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and
   some Z80 machines).  See also <name>splat</name>.The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's
   other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more and
   more like a serious <name>misfeature</name> as the use of
   international networks continues to increase (see 
   <name>software rot</name>).
   Hardware and software from the U.S. still tends to
   embody the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that
   characters have 7 bits; this is a major irritant to people who want to use
   a character set suited to their own languages.  Perversely, though, efforts
   to solve this problem by proliferating &#8216;national&#8217; character
   sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use a <emphasis>smaller</emphasis>
   subset common to all those in use.</def>

    <def> [common] A hole in the security of a system deliberately left in

   always sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of the box
   with privileged accounts intended for use by field service technicians or
   the vendor's maintenance programmers.  Syn.  
   <name>trap door</name>; may also be called a <emphasis>wormhole</emphasis>.  See also 
   <name>iron box</name>, <name>cracker</name>,
   <name>worm</name>, <name>logic bomb</name>.Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than
   anyone expected or planned, and a few have become widely known.  Ken
   Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the existence of a
   back door in early Unix versions that may have qualified as the most
   fiendishly clever security hack of all time.  In this scheme, the C
   compiler contained code that would recognize when the <emphasis>login</emphasis> command was being recompiled and insert
   some code recognizing a password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to
   the system whether or not an account had been created for him.Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the
   source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler.  But to
   recompile the compiler, you have to <emphasis>use</emphasis> the compiler
   &#8212; so Thompson also arranged that the compiler would
   <emphasis>recognize when it was compiling a version of itself</emphasis>,
   and insert into the recompiled compiler the code to insert into the
   recompiled <emphasis>login</emphasis> the code to allow
   Thompson entry &#8212; and, of course, the code to recognize itself and do
   the whole thing again the next time around!  And having done this once, he
   was then able to recompile the compiler from the original sources; the hack
   perpetuated itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but
   with no trace in the sources.The Turing lecture that reported this truly moby hack was later
   published as <italic>Reflections on Trusting Trust</italic>,
   Communications of the ACM 27, 8 (August 1984),
   pp. 761--763 (text available at http://www.acm.org/classics/).
   Ken Thompson has since confirmed that this hack was implemented and that
   the Trojan Horse code did appear in the login binary of a Unix Support
   group machine.  Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed.  Your
   editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked login
   did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled at least
   one late-night login across the network by someone using the login name

    <def> A programming language, originally designed for Dartmouth's
   experimental timesharing system in the early 1960s, which for many years
   was the leading cause of brain damage in proto-hackers.  Edsger W. Dijkstra
   observed in Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal
   Perspective that <italic>It is practically impossible to teach
   good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC:
   as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of
   regeneration.</italic> This is another case (like
   <name>Pascal</name>) of the cascading
   <name>lossage</name> that happens when a language deliberately
   designed as an educational toy gets taken too seriously.  A novice can
   write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very easily;
   writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits
   that will make it harder to use more powerful languages well.  This
   wouldn't be so bad if historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on
   low-end micros in the 1980s.  As it is, it probably ruined tens of
   thousands of potential wizards.[1995: Some languages called <italic>BASIC</italic> aren't quite this
   nasty any more, having acquired Pascal- and C-like procedures and control
   structures and shed their line numbers. &#8212;ESR]BASIC stands for <italic>Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction

   the thousands of local BBS systems that operated during the pre-Internet

   fun out of their homes on MS-DOS boxes with a single modem line each.  Fans
   of Usenet and Internet or the big commercial timesharing bboards such as
   CompuServe and GEnie tended to consider local BBSes the low-rent district
   of the hacker culture, but they served a valuable function by knitting
   together lots of hackers and users in the personal-micro world who would
   otherwise have been unable to exchange code at all.  Post-Internet, BBSs
   are likely to be local newsgroups on an ISP; efficiency has increased but a

   different systems that its creator confesses to having lost count. It has
   only one data type (a machine word) which can be used as an integer, a

   depending on context.  BCPL was a precursor of C, which inherited some of

   that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only misplaced.  This
   appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term &#8216;bit box&#8217;,
   about which the same legend was current; old-time hackers also report that

   filling up the bit bucket.  A qualified computer technician can empty a

    <def> (alt.: <emphasis>bit-shift keyboard</emphasis>) A
   non-standard keyboard layout that seems to have originated with the
   Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several years on early computer
   equipment.  The ASR-33 was a mechanical device (see
   <name>EOU</name>), so the only way to generate the character
   codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage.  The design of the
   ASR-33 assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified
   by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed.  In order to
   avoid making the thing even more of a kluge than it already was, the design
   had to group characters that shared the same basic bit pattern on one
   key.Looking at the ASCII chart, we find:This is why the characters !"#$%&amp;'() appear where they do on a
   Teletype (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space). The Teletype
   Model 33 was actually designed before ASCII existed, and was originally
   intended to use a code that contained these two rows:The result would have been something closer to a normal keyboard.
   But as it happened, Teletype had to use a lot of persuasion just to keep
   ASCII, and the Model 33 keyboard, from looking like this instead:Teletype's was <emphasis>not</emphasis> the weirdest variant of the
   <name>QWERTY</name> layout widely seen, by the way; that prize
   should probably go to one of several (differing) arrangements on IBM's even
   clunkier 026 and 029 card punches.When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there
   was no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be laid out.
   Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard, while others used the
   flexibility of electronic circuitry to make their product look like an
   office typewriter.  Either choice was supported by the ANSI computer
   keyboard standard, X4.14-1971, which referred to the alternatives as
   <italic>logical bit pairing</italic> and <italic>typewriter
   pairing</italic>. These alternatives became known as <emphasis>bit-paired</emphasis> and <emphasis>typewriter-paired</emphasis> keyboards.  To a hacker, the
   bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical &#8212; and because most
   hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type, there was little
   pressure from the pioneering users to adapt keyboards to the typewriter
   standard.The doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale introduction
   of the computer terminal into the normal office environment, where
   out-and-out technophobes were expected to use the equipment.  The <emphasis>typewriter-paired</emphasis> standard became universal,
   X4.14 was superseded by X4.23-1982, <emphasis>bit-paired</emphasis> hardware was quickly junked or
   relegated to dusty corners, and both terms passed into disuse.However, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the
   argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or nonexistent. As
   a result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on PCs, Unix boxen
   etc. still has all of the !"#$%&amp;'() characters above the numbers in the
   ASR-33 layout.</def>

    <def> [common] Front-panel diagnostic lights on a computer, esp. a
   <name>dinosaur</name>.  Now that dinosaurs are rare, this term
   usually refers to status lights on a modem, network hub, or the
   like.This term derives from the last word of the famous blackletter-Gothic
   sign in mangled pseudo-German that once graced about half the computer
   rooms in the English-speaking world.  One version ran in its entirety as
   follows:This silliness dates back at least as far as 1955 at IBM
   and had already gone international by the early 1960s, when it
   was reported at London University's ATLAS computing site.  There are
   several variants of it in circulation, some of which actually do end with
   the word &#8216;blinkenlights&#8217;.In an amusing example of turnabout-is-fair-play, German hackers have
   developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in fractured
   English, one of which is reproduced here:See also <name>geef</name>.Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because
   they were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel.  Sadly, very few
   computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard certainly don't
   count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost of front-panel cutouts,
   almost nobody needs or wants to interpret machine-register states on the
   fly anymore) are only part of the story.  Another part of it is that
   radio-frequency leakage from the lamp wiring was beginning to be a problem
   as far back as transistor machines.  But the most fundamental fact is that
   there are very few signals slow enough to blink an LED these days!  With
   slow CPUs, you could watch the bus register or instruction counter tick,
   but even at 33/66/150MHz (let alone gigahertz speeds) it's all a
   blur.Despite this, a couple of relatively recent computer designs of note
   have featured programmable blinkenlights that were added just because they
   looked cool.  The Connection Machine, a 65,536-processor parallel computer
   designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a
   grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving
   <name>life</name> patterns.  A few years later the ill-fated
   BeBox (a personal computer designed to run the BeOS operating system)
   featured twin rows of blinkenlights on the case front. When Be,
   Inc. decided to get out of the hardware business in 1996 and instead ported
   their OS to the PowerPC and later to the Intel architecture, many users
   suffered severely from the absence of their beloved blinkenlights.  Before
   long an external version of the blinkenlights driven by a PC serial port
   became available; there is some sort of plot symmetry in the fact that it
   was assembled by a German.Finally, a version updated for the Internet has been seen on
   news.admin.net-abuse.email:This newest version partly reflects reports that the word
   &#8216;blinkenlights&#8217; is (in 1999) undergoing something of a revival
   in usage, but applied to networking equipment. The transmit and receive
   lights on routers, activity lights on switches and hubs, and other network
   equipment often blink in visually pleasing and seemingly coordinated
   ways. Although this is different in some ways from register readings, a
   tall stack of Cisco equipment or a 19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can
   provoke a similar feeling of hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened network
   operations center or server room.The ancestor of the original blinkenlights posters of the 1950s was
   probably this:We are informed that cod-German parodies of this kind were very 
   common in Allied machine shops during and following WWII.  Germans,
   then as now, had a reputation for being both good with precision
   machinery and prone to officious notices.</def>

   a name-part, followed by a street-address part, followed by a zip-code
   part.  A personal-part consists of either a first name or an initial
   followed by a dot.  A name-part consists of either: a personal-part
   followed by a last name followed by an optional jr-part (Jr., Sr., or
   dynastic number) and end-of-line, or a personal part followed by a name
   part (this rule illustrates the use of recursion in BNFs, covering the case
   of people who use multiple first and middle names and/or initials).  A
   street address consists of an optional apartment specifier, followed by a
   street number, followed by a street name.  A zip-part consists of a
   town-name, followed by a comma, followed by a state code, followed by a
   ZIP-code followed by an end-of-line.</italic> Note that many things (such as
   the format of a personal-part, apartment specifier, or ZIP-code) are left
   unspecified.  These are presumed to be obvious from context or detailed
   somewhere nearby.  See also <name>parse</name>. 2. Any of a number of variants and extensions of BNF proper,
   possibly containing some or all of the <name>regexp</name>
   wildcards such as * or +.  In fact the example above isn't the pure form
   invented for the Algol-60 report; it uses [], which was introduced a few years later in IBM's
   PL/I definition but is now universally recognized.   3. In <name>science-fiction fandom</name>, a
   &#8216;Big-Name Fan&#8217; (someone famous or notorious).  Years ago a fan
   started handing out black-on-green BNF buttons at SF conventions; this

   <italic>Bob</italic>, despite the fact that no <italic>Bob</italic> was

   <italic>Bob</italic> on duty at all times, just in case.This sillyness snowballed inexorably.  Shift leaders and managers
   began to refer to their groups of <italic>bobs</italic>.  Whole ranks of
   support machines were set up (and still exist in the DNS as of 1999) as
   bob1 through bobN. Then came alt.tech-support.recovery, and it was filled

    <def> (var.: <emphasis>stupid-sort</emphasis>) The

   algorithm).  Bogo-sort is equivalent to repeatedly throwing a deck of cards
   in the air, picking them up at random, and then testing whether they are in
   order.  It serves as a sort of canonical example of awfulness.  Looking at
   a program and seeing a dumb algorithm, one might say <italic>Oh, I see, this
   program uses bogo-sort.</italic> Esp.  appropriate for algorithms with
   factorial or super-exponential running time in the average case and
   probabilistically infinite worst-case running time.  Compare
   <name>bogus</name>, <name>brute force</name>.A spectacular variant of bogo-sort has been proposed which has the
   interesting property that, if the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum
   mechanics is true, it can sort an arbitrarily large array in linear time.
   (In the Many-Worlds model, the result of any quantum action is to split the
   universe-before into a sheaf of universes-after, one for each possible way
   the state vector can collapse; in any one of the universes-after the result
   appears random.)  The steps are: 1. Permute the array randomly using a
   quantum process, 2. If the array is not sorted, destroy the universe
   (checking that the list is sorted requires O(n) time).  Implementation of
   step 2 is left as an exercise for the reader.</def>

   first popularized there about 1975-76.  These coinages spread into
   hackerdom from CMU and MIT.  Most of them remained wordplay objects rather

   <name>quantum bogodynamics</name> and the related but unlisted
   <name>Dr. Fred Mbogo</name>.By the early 1980s &#8216;bogus&#8217; was also current in something

   that these uses of <emphasis>bogus</emphasis> grate on
   British nerves; in Britain the word means, rather specifically,
   &#8216;counterfeit&#8217;, as in <italic>a bogus 10-pound note</italic>.

    <def> [techspeak; from &#8216;by one's bootstraps&#8217;] To load and
   initialize the operating system on a machine.  This usage is no longer
   jargon (having passed into techspeak) but has given rise to some
   derivatives that are still jargon.The derivative <emphasis>reboot</emphasis> implies
   that the machine hasn't been down for long, or that the boot is a
   <name>bounce</name> (sense 4) intended to clear some state of
   <name>wedgitude</name>.  This is sometimes used of human thought
   processes, as in the following exchange: <italic>You've lost me.</italic>
   <italic>OK, reboot.  Here's the theory....</italic>This term is also found in the variants <emphasis>cold boot</emphasis> (from power-off condition) and
   <emphasis>warm boot</emphasis> (with the CPU and all
   devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software
   crash).Another variant: <emphasis>soft boot</emphasis>,
   reinitialization of only part of a system, under control of other software
   still running: <italic>If you're running the mess-dos
   emulator, control-alt-insert will cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while
   leaving the rest of the system running.</italic>Opposed to this there is <emphasis>hard
   boot</emphasis>, which connotes hostility towards or frustration with the
   machine being booted: <italic>I'll have to hard-boot this losing
   Sun.</italic> <italic>I recommend booting it hard.</italic> One often
   hard-boots by performing a <name>power cycle</name>.Historical note: this term derives from <emphasis>bootstrap loader</emphasis>, a short program that was read
   in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in from the front panel switches.
   This program was always very short (great efforts were expended on making
   it short in order to minimize the labor and chance of error involved in
   toggling it in), but was just smart enough to read in a slightly more
   complex program (usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it
   handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the
   application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk drive.
   Thus, in successive steps, the computer &#8216;pulled itself up by its
   bootstraps&#8217; to a useful operating state.  Nowadays the bootstrap is
   usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first stage in from a fixed
   location on the disk, called the &#8216;boot block&#8217;.  When this
   program gains control, it is powerful enough to load the actual OS and hand
   control over to it.</def>

    1. An <name>IRC</name> or <name>MUD</name> user
   who is actually a program.  On IRC, typically the robot provides some
   useful service.  Examples are NickServ, which tries to prevent random users
   from adopting <name>nick</name>s already claimed by others, and
   MsgServ, which allows one to send asynchronous messages to be delivered
   when the recipient signs on.  Also common are &#8216;annoybots&#8217;, such
   as KissServ, which perform no useful function except to send cute messages
   to other people.  Service bots are less common on MUDs; but some others,
   such as the &#8216;Julia&#8217; bot active in 1990--91, have been
   remarkably impressive Turing-test experiments, able to pass as human for as
   long as ten or fifteen minutes of conversation.  2. An AI-controlled player in a computer game (especially a
   first-person shooter such as Quake) which, unlike ordinary monsters,
   operates like a human-controlled player, with access to a player's weapons
   and abilities.  An example can be found at http://www.telefragged.com/thefatal/.

    <def> A measurement of the severity of spam invented by long-time hacker

   into account the fact that excessive multi-posting
   <name>EMP</name> is worse than excessive cross-posting
   <name>ECP</name>.  The Breidbart Index is computed as follows:
   For each article in a spam, take the square-root of the number of
   newsgroups to which the article is posted. The Breidbart Index is the sum
   of the square roots of all of the posts in the spam. For example, one
   article posted to nine newsgroups and again to sixteen would have BI =
   sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 7.  It is generally agreed that a spam is cancelable
   if the Breidbart Index exceeds 20.The Breidbart Index accumulates over a 45-day window. Ten articles
   yesterday and ten articles today and ten articles tomorrow add up to a
   30-article spam. Spam fighters will often reset the count if you can
   convince them that the spam was accidental and/or you have seen the error
   of your ways and won't repeat it.  Breidbart Index can accumulate over
   multiple authors. For example, the <italic>Make Money Fast</italic> pyramid

    </abbrev>
    <def> Describes a primitive programming style, one in which the programmer
   relies on the computer's processing power instead of using his or her own
   intelligence to simplify the problem, often ignoring problems of scale and
   applying naive methods suited to small problems directly to large ones.
   The term can also be used in reference to programming style: brute-force
   programs are written in a heavyhanded, tedious way, full of repetition and
   devoid of any elegance or useful abstraction (see also 
   <name>brute force and ignorance</name>).The <name>canonical</name> example of a brute-force
   algorithm is associated with the &#8216;traveling salesman problem&#8217;
   (TSP), a classical <name>NP-</name>hard problem: Suppose a person
   is in, say, Boston, and wishes to drive to N other
   cities.  In what order should the cities be visited in order to minimize
   the distance travelled?  The brute-force method is to simply generate all
   possible routes and compare the distances; while guaranteed to work and
   simple to implement, this algorithm is clearly very stupid in that it
   considers even obviously absurd routes (like going from Boston to Houston
   via San Francisco and New York, in that order).  For very small
   N it works well, but it rapidly becomes absurdly
   inefficient when N increases (for N =
   15, there are already 1,307,674,368,000 possible routes to
   consider, and for N = 1000 &#8212; well, see
   <name>bignum</name>).  Sometimes, unfortunately, there is no
   better general solution than brute force.  See also
   <name>NP-</name> and <name>rubber-hose
   cryptanalysis</name>.A more simple-minded example of brute-force programming is finding
   the smallest number in a large list by first using an existing program to
   sort the list in ascending order, and then picking the first number off the
   front.Whether brute-force programming should actually be considered stupid
   or not depends on the context; if the problem is not terribly big, the
   extra CPU time spent on a brute-force solution may cost less than the
   programmer time it would take to develop a more &#8216;intelligent&#8217;
   algorithm.  Additionally, a more intelligent algorithm may imply more
   long-term complexity cost and bug-chasing than are justified by the speed
   improvement.Ken Thompson, co-inventor of Unix, is reported to have uttered the
   epigram <italic>When in doubt, use brute force</italic>.  He probably
   intended this as a <name>ha ha only serious</name>, but the
   original Unix kernel's preference for simple, robust, and portable
   algorithms over <name>brittle</name> &#8216;smart&#8217; ones
   does seem to have been a significant factor in the success of that OS.
   Like so many other tradeoffs in software design, the choice between brute
   force and complex, finely-tuned cleverness is often a difficult one that
   requires both engineering savvy and delicate esthetic judgment.</def>

   Wirth when <emphasis>he</emphasis> was at Stanford in 1964--65; he first
   suggested the idea of an EDIT key to set the 8th bit of an otherwise 7-bit
   ASCII character).  It seems that, unknown to Wirth, certain Stanford
   hackers had privately nicknamed him &#8216;Bucky&#8217; after a prominent
   portion of his dental anatomy, and this nickname transferred to the bit.
   Bucky-bit commands were used in a number of editors written at Stanford,
   including most notably TV-EDIT and NLS.The term spread to MIT and CMU early and is now in general use.
   Ironically, Wirth himself remained unaware of its derivation for nearly 30

    <def> What happens when you try to stuff more data into a buffer (holding

   all the data that must accumulate before a piece of it can be processed.
   For example, in a text-processing tool that <name>crunch</name>es
   a line at a time, a short line buffer can result in
   <name>lossage</name> as input from a long line overflows the

   story in which a technician solved a <name>glitch</name> in the
   Harvard Mark II machine by pulling an actual insect out from between the
   contacts of one of its relays, and she subsequently promulgated
   <name>bug</name> in its hackish sense as a joke about the
   incident (though, as she was careful to admit, she was not there when it
   happened).  For many years the logbook associated with the incident and the
   actual bug in question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval Surface
   Warfare Center (NSWC).  The entire story, with a picture of the logbook and
   the moth taped into it, is recorded in the Annals of the History
   of Computing, Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981), pp. 285--286.The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads <italic>1545
   Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay.  First actual case of bug being
   found</italic>.  This wording establishes that the term was already in use
   at the time in its current specific sense &#8212; and Hopper herself
   reports that the term <emphasis>bug</emphasis> was
   regularly applied to problems in radar electronics during WWII.Indeed, the use of <emphasis>bug</emphasis> to mean
   an industrial defect was already established in Thomas Edison's time, and a
   more specific and rather modern use can be found in an electrical handbook
   from 1896 (Hawkin's New Catechism of Electricity,
   Theo. Audel &amp; Co.)  which says: <italic>The term &#8216;bug&#8217; is
   used to a limited extent to designate any fault or trouble in the
   connections or working of electric apparatus.</italic> It further notes that
   the term is <italic>said to have originated in quadruplex telegraphy and
   have been transferred to all electric apparatus.</italic>The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the
   term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which <italic>bugs in a
   telephone cable</italic> were blamed for noisy lines.  Though this
   derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory of a
   joke first current among <emphasis>telegraph</emphasis> operators more than
   a century ago!Or perhaps not a joke.  Historians of the field inform us that the
   term <italic>bug</italic> was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy
   to refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would send a
   string of dots if you held them down.  In fact, the Vibroplex keyers (which
   were among the most common of this type) even had a graphic of a beetle on
   them (and still do)!  While the ability to send repeated dots automatically
   was very useful for professional morse code operators, these were also
   significantly trickier to use than the older manual keyers, and it could
   take some practice to ensure one didn't introduce extraneous dots into the
   code by holding the key down a fraction too long.  In the hands of an
   inexperienced operator, a Vibroplex <italic>bug</italic> on the line could
   mean that a lot of garbled Morse would soon be coming your way.Further, the term <italic>bug</italic> has long been used among radio
   technicians to describe a device that converts electromagnetic field
   variations into acoustic signals.  It is used to trace radio interference
   and look for dangerous radio emissions.  Radio community usage derives from
   the roach-like shape of the first versions used by 19th century physicists.
   The first versions consisted of a coil of wire (roach body), with the two
   wire ends sticking out and bent back to nearly touch forming a spark gap
   (roach antennae).  The bug is to the radio technician what the stethoscope
   is to the stereotypical medical doctor.  This sense is almost certainly
   ancestral to modern use of <italic>bug</italic> for a covert monitoring
   device, but may also have contributed to the use of <italic>bug</italic> for
   the effects of radio interference itself.Actually, use of <emphasis>bug</emphasis> in the
   general sense of a disruptive event goes back to Shakespeare!  (Henry VI,
   part III - Act V, Scene II: King Edward: <italic>So, lie thou there. Die
   thou; and die our fear; For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.</italic>)
   In the first edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary one meaning of
   <emphasis>bug</emphasis> is <italic>A frightful object; a
   walking spectre</italic>; this is traced to &#8216;bugbear&#8217;, a Welsh
   term for a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the circle)
   has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon through fantasy
   role-playing games.In any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects.  Here
   is a plausible conversation that never actually happened: <italic>There is a
   bug in this ant farm!</italic> <italic>What do you mean?  I don't see any
   ants in it.</italic> <italic>That's the bug.</italic>A careful discussion of the etymological issues can be found in a
   paper by Fred R. Shapiro, 1987, <italic>Entomology of the Computer Bug:
   History and Folklore</italic>, American Speech 62(4):376-378.[There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved to
   the Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so asserted.  A
   correspondent who thought to check discovered that the bug was not there.
   While investigating this in late 1990, your editor discovered that the NSWC
   still had the bug, but had unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to
   accept it &#8212; and that the present curator of their History of American
   Technology Museum didn't know this and agreed that it would make a
   worthwhile exhibit.  It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991, but due
   to space and money constraints was not actually exhibited for years
   afterwards.  Thus, the process of investigating the original-computer-bug
   bug fixed it in an entirely unexpected way, by making the myth true!

    <def> [very common; historically, &#8216;according to religious
   law&#8217;] The usual or standard state or manner of something.  This word
   has a somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics.  Two formulas such as
   9 + x and x +
   9 are said to be equivalent because they mean the same
   thing, but the second one is in <emphasis>canonical
   form</emphasis> because it is written in the usual way, with the highest
   power of x first.  Usually there are fixed
   rules you can use to decide whether something is in canonical form.  The
   jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning, acquired its present
   loading in computer-science culture largely through its prominence in
   Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and mathematical logic (see
   <name>Knights of the Lambda Calculus</name>).  Compare
   <name>vanilla</name>.Non-technical academics do not use the adjective
   &#8216;canonical&#8217; in any of the senses defined above with any
   regularity; they do however use the nouns <emphasis>canon</emphasis> and <emphasis>canonicity</emphasis> (not **canonicalness or
   **canonicality). The <emphasis>canon</emphasis> of a given
   author is the complete body of authentic works by that author (this usage
   is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as well as to literary scholars).
   &#8216;<emphasis>The</emphasis> canon&#8217; is the body of works in a
   given field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed
   worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate.The word &#8216;canon&#8217; has an interesting history.  It derives
   ultimately from the Greek
   &#954;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957; (akin to the
   English &#8216;cane&#8217;) referring to a reed.  Reeds were used for
   measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word &#8216;canon&#8217;
   meant a rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of scriptures
   within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a rule for the
   religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages stem from this instance
   of a defined and accepted body of work.  Alongside this usage was the
   promulgation of &#8216;canons&#8217; (&#8216;rules&#8217;) for the
   government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages (<italic>according
   to religious law</italic>) derive from this use of the Latin
   &#8216;canon&#8217;.Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new
   at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the incessant use of jargon.
   Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS made a point of using as much of it
   as possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally,
   in one conversation, he used the word <emphasis>canonical</emphasis> in jargon-like fashion without
   thinking.  Steele: <italic>Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon
   too!</italic> Stallman: <italic>What did he say?</italic> Steele: <italic>Bob
   just used &#8216;canonical&#8217; in the canonical way.</italic>Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly
   defined as the way <emphasis>hackers</emphasis> normally expect things to
   be.  Thus, a hacker may claim with a straight face that &#8216;according to
   religious law&#8217; is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the canonical meaning of
   <emphasis>canonical</emphasis>.</def>

    <def> A style of (incompetent) programming dominated by ritual inclusion
   of code or program structures that serve no real purpose.  A cargo cult
   programmer will usually explain the extra code as a way of working around
   some bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug nor the
   reason the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully understood
   (compare <name>shotgun debugging</name>, 
   <name>voodoo programming</name>).The term &#8216;cargo cult&#8217; is a reference to aboriginal
   religions that grew up in the South Pacific after World War II.  The
   practices of these cults center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes
   and military style landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of the
   god-like airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the war.
   Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's characterization of
   certain practices as <italic>cargo cult science</italic> in his book

    <def> [University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a machine word).
   This term was used by FORTH hackers during the late 1970s/early 1980s; it
   is said to have been archaic then, and may now be obsolete.  It was coined
   in revolt against the promiscuous use of &#8216;word&#8217; for anything
   between 16 and 32 bits; &#8216;word&#8217; has an additional special
   meaning for FORTH hacks that made the overloading intolerable.  For similar
   reasons, <emphasis>/gaw´bl/</emphasis> (spelled
   &#8216;gawble&#8217; or possibly &#8216;gawbul&#8217;) was in use as a term
   for 32 or 48 bits (presumably a full machine word, but our sources are
   unclear on this).  These terms are more easily understood if one thinks of
   them as faithful phonetic spellings of &#8216;chomp&#8217; and
   &#8216;gobble&#8217; pronounced in a Florida or other Southern
   U.S. dialect.  For general discussion of similar terms, see

   close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much like what Pac-Man

    <def>A syndrome of certain Iomega ZIP drives, named for the clicking noise
   that is caused by the malady. An affected drive will, after accepting a
   disk, start making a clicking noise and refuse to eject the disk. A
   common solution for retrieving the disk is to insert the bent end of a
   paper clip into a small hole adjacent to the slot. <italic>Clicked</italic>
   disks are generally unusable after being retrieved from the drive.The clicking noise is caused by the drive's read/write head bumping
   against its movement stops when it fails to find track 0 on the disk,
   causing the head to become misaligned. This can happen when the drive has
   been subjected to a physical shock, or when the disk is exposed to an
   electromagnetic field, such as that of the CRT.  Another common cause
   is when a package of disks is armed with an anti-theft strip
   at a store. When the clerk scans the product to disarm the strip, it can
   demagnetize the disks, wiping out track 0.There is evidence that the click of death is a communicable disease;
   a <italic>clicked</italic> disk can cause the read/write head of a "clean"
   drive to become misaligned. Iomega at first denied the existence of the
   click of death, but eventually offered to replace free of charge any drives

    <def> Hackish speech makes heavy use of pseudo-mathematical metaphors.
   Four particularly important ones involve the terms <emphasis>coefficient</emphasis>, <emphasis>factor</emphasis>, <emphasis>index of
   X</emphasis>, and <emphasis>quotient</emphasis>.  They are
   often loosely applied to things you cannot really be quantitative about,
   but there are subtle distinctions among them that convey information about
   the way the speaker mentally models whatever he or she is describing.
   <emphasis>Foo factor</emphasis> and <emphasis>foo quotient</emphasis> tend to describe something for
   which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical example is
   <name>fudge factor</name>.  It's not important how much you're
   fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.  You
   might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.  Quotient tends to
   imply that the property is a ratio of two opposing factors: <italic>I would
   have won except for my luck quotient.</italic> This could also be <italic>I
   would have won except for the luck factor</italic>, but using
   <emphasis>quotient</emphasis> emphasizes that it was bad luck overpowering
   good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering your own).  <emphasis>Foo index</emphasis> and <emphasis>coefficient of foo</emphasis> both tend to imply that foo
   is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that can be larger or
   smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or person as having a <emphasis>high bogosity index</emphasis>, whereas you would be less
   likely to speak of a <emphasis>high bogosity
   factor</emphasis>.  <emphasis>Foo index</emphasis>
   suggests that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane
   cost-of-living index; <emphasis>coefficient of
   foo</emphasis> suggests that foo is a fundamental quantity, as in a
   coefficient of friction.  The choice between these terms is often one of
   personal preference; e.g., some people might feel that bogosity is a
   fundamental attribute and thus say <emphasis>coefficient
   of bogosity</emphasis>, whereas others might feel it is a combination of
   factors and thus say <emphasis>bogosity
   index</emphasis>.</def>

      </item>
    </abbrev>
    <def> A semi-mythical language construct dual to the &#8216;go to&#8217;;
   COME FROM &lt;label&gt; would cause the
   referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor, so that if the program ever
   reached it control would quietly and <name>automagically</name>
   be transferred to the statement following the COME
   FROM.  COME FROM was first
   proposed in R. Lawrence Clark's A Linguistic Contribution to
   GOTO-less programming, which appeared in a 1973
   <name>Datamation</name> issue (and was reprinted in the April
   1984 issue of Communications of the ACM).  This
   parodied the then-raging &#8216;structured programming&#8217;
   <name>holy wars</name> (see <name>considered
   harmful</name>).  Mythically, some variants are the <emphasis>assigned COME FROM</emphasis> and the <emphasis>computed COME FROM</emphasis> (parodying some nasty
   control constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course,
   multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having more than
   one COME FROM statement coming from the
   same label.In some ways the FORTRAN DO looks
   like a COME FROM statement.  After the
   terminating statement number/CONTINUE is
   reached, control continues at the statement following the DO.  Some
   generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than CONTINUE) for the statement, leading to examples
   like:in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10.  (This
   is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear to have
   anything to do with the flow of control at all!)  While sufficiently
   astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this form of COME FROM statement isn't completely general.  After
   all, control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The
   implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN, ca. 1975
   (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040 ten years
   earlier).  The statement AT 100 would
   perform a COME FROM 100.  It was intended
   strictly as a debugging aid, with dire consequences promised to anyone so
   deranged as to use it in production code.  More horrible things had already
   been perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
   contemplate the ALTER verb in
   <name>COBOL</name>.  COME FROM
   was supported under its own name for the first time 15 years later, in
   C-INTERCAL (see <name>INTERCAL</name>,
   <name>retrocomputing</name>); knowledgeable observers are still
   reeling from the shock.</def>

   <italic>hack-o-rama!</italic> <italic>core dump frenzy!</italic>).All the generic differences within the anglophone world inevitably

   and zeta are usually pronounced <emphasis>/bee´t@/</emphasis> and <emphasis>/zee´t@/</emphasis>; meta may also be
   pronounced <emphasis>/mee´t@/</emphasis>.
   Various punctuators (and even letters - Z is called &#8216;zed&#8217;, not
   &#8216;zee&#8217;) are named differently: most crucially, for hackish,
   where Americans use &#8216;parens&#8217;, &#8216;brackets&#8217; and

    <def> 1. [common] A notional unit of computing power combining instruction
   speed and storage capacity, dimensioned roughly in instructions-per-second
   times megabytes-of-main-store times megabytes-of-mass-storage.  <italic>That
   machine can't run GNU Emacs, it doesn't have enough computrons!</italic>
   This usage is usually found in metaphors that treat computing power as a
   fungible commodity good, like a crop yield or diesel horsepower.  See
   <name>bitty box</name>, 
   <name>Get a real computer!</name>, <name>toy</name>,
   <name>crank</name>.   2. A mythical subatomic particle that bears the unit quantity of
   computation or information, in much the same way that an electron bears one
   unit of electric charge (see also <name>bogon</name>).  An
   elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons has been developed based
   on the physical fact that the molecules in a solid object move more rapidly
   as it is heated.  It is argued that an object melts because the molecules
   have lost their information about where they are supposed to be (that is,
   they have emitted computrons).  This explains why computers get so hot and
   require air conditioning; they use up computrons.  Conversely, it should be
   possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path of a computron
   beam.  It is believed that this may also explain why machines that work at
   the factory fail in the computer room: the computrons there have been all
   used up by the other hardware.  (The popularity of this theory probably
   owes something to the Warlock stories by Larry
   Niven, the best known being What Good is a Glass
   Dagger?, in which magic is fueled by an exhaustible natural
   resource called mana.)</def>

   Communications of the ACM, Goto Statement

   As it  turns
   out, the title under which the letter appeared was actually

   the resulting acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no

   practice. (Years afterwards, a contrary view was uttered in a CACM letter
   called, inevitably, &#8216;Goto considered harmful&#8217;

   of both serious papers and parodies have borne titles of the form
   X considered Y.  The structured-programming wars
   eventually blew over with the realization that both sides were wrong, but

    <def> A game between <emphasis>assembler</emphasis>

   A. K. Dewdney's column in Scientific American

   Experience a decade earlier.  The game was actually devised and
   played by Victor Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and Doug McIlroy in the
   early 1960s (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author,
   but was not involved).  Their original game was called &#8216;Darwin&#8217;

   The British seem to prefer the usage <emphasis>cosmic
   showers</emphasis>; <emphasis>alpha particles</emphasis>
   is also heard, because stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip
   can cause single-bit errors (this becomes increasingly more likely as
   memory sizes and densities increase).Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not
   (except occasionally in spaceborne computers).  Intel could not explain
   random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis was cosmic rays.
   So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe, using 25 tons of the stuff,
   and used two identical boards for testing.  One was placed in the safe, one
   outside.  The hypothesis was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit
   drops, they should see a statistically significant difference between the
   error rates on the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.
   Further investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
   to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser degree
   uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is impossible to
   eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly distributed through the
   earth's crust, with the statistically insignificant exception of uranium
   lodes) it became obvious that one has to design memories to withstand these
   hits.</def>

    <def> One who breaks security on a system.  Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in
   defense against journalistic misuse of <name>hacker</name> (q.v.,
   sense 8).  An earlier attempt to establish <emphasis>worm</emphasis> in this sense around 1981--82 on Usenet
   was largely a failure.Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against the
   theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. The neologism
   <italic>cracker</italic> in this sense may have been influenced not so much
   by the term <italic>safe-cracker</italic> as by the non-jargon term
   <italic>cracker</italic>, which in Middle English meant an obnoxious person
   (e.g., <italic>What cracker is this same that deafs our ears / With this
   abundance of superfluous breath?</italic> &#8212; Shakespeare's King John, Act
   II, Scene I) and in modern colloquial American English survives as a barely
   gentler synonym for <italic>white trash</italic>.While it is expected that any real hacker will have done some playful
   cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past
   <name>larval stage</name> is expected to have outgrown the desire
   to do so except for immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if
   it's necessary to get around some security in order to get some work
   done).Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom than
   the <name>mundane</name> reader misled by sensationalistic
   journalism might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit,
   very secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
   poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to describe
   <emphasis>themselves</emphasis> as hackers, most true hackers consider them
   a separate and lower form of life.  An easy way for outsiders to spot
   the difference is that crackers use grandiose screen names that conceal
   their identities.  Hackers never do this; they only rarely use
   noms de guerre at all, and when they
   do it is for display rather than concealment.Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
   imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than breaking
   into someone else's has to be pretty <name>losing</name>.  Some
   other reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the entries on

    <def> [from the American scatologism <emphasis>crock of
   shit</emphasis>]  1. An awkward feature or programming technique that ought to be made
   cleaner.  For example, using small integers to represent error codes
   without the program interpreting them to the user (as in, for example, Unix
   make1,
   which returns code 139 for a process that dies due to
   <name>segfault</name>).   2. A technique that works acceptably, but which is quite prone to
   failure if disturbed in the least.  For example, a too-clever programmer
   might write an assembler which mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric
   opcodes algorithmically, a trick which depends far too intimately on the
   particular bit patterns of the opcodes.  (For another example of
   programming with a dependence on actual opcode values, see 
   The Story of Mel' in Appendix A.)  Many crocks have a tightly woven,
   almost completely unmodifiable structure.  See

    <def> [orig. by SF writer Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A
   subgenre of SF launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel
   Neuromancer (though its roots go back through Vernor
   Vinge's True Names (see the Bibliography in Appendix C) to John
   Brunner's 1975 novel The Shockwave Rider).  Gibson's
   near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture
   enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the
   future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and
   tremendously stimulating.  Gibson's work was widely imitated, in particular
   by the short-lived but innovative Max Headroom TV
   series.  See <name>cyberspace</name>, <name>ice</name>,
   <name>jack in</name>, <name>go flatline</name>.Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or fashion
   trend that calls itself &#8216;cyberpunk&#8217;, associated especially with
   the rave/techno subculture.  Hackers have mixed feelings about this.  On
   the one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to be shallow
   trendoids in black leather who have substituted enthusiastic blathering
   about technology for actually learning and <emphasis>doing</emphasis> it.
   Attitude is no substitute for competence.  On the other hand, at least
   cyberpunks are excited about the right things and properly respectful of
   hacking talent in those who have it.  The general consensus is to tolerate
   them politely in hopes that they'll attract people who grow into being true
   hackers.</def>

    <def> 1. Notional &#8216;information-space&#8217; loaded with visual cues
   and navigable with brain-computer interfaces called <emphasis>cyberspace decks</emphasis>; a characteristic prop of
   <name>cyberpunk</name> SF.  Serious efforts to construct
   <name>virtual reality</name> interfaces modeled explicitly on
   Gibsonian cyberspace are under way, using more conventional devices such as
   glove sensors and binocular TV headsets.  Few hackers are prepared to deny
   outright the possibility of a cyberspace someday evolving out of the
   network (see <name>the network</name>).   2. The Internet or <name>Matrix</name> (sense #2) as a
   whole, considered as a crude cyberspace (sense 1).  Although this usage
   became widely popular in the mainstream press during 1994 when the Internet
   exploded into public awareness, it is strongly deprecated among hackers
   because the Internet does not meet the high, SF-inspired standards they
   have for true cyberspace technology. Thus, this use of the term usually
   tags a <name>wannabee</name> or outsider.  Oppose
   <name>meatspace</name>.   3. Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the mind of a person in
   <name>hack mode</name>.  Some hackers report experiencing strong
   synesthetic imagery when in hack mode; interestingly, independent reports
   from multiple sources suggest that there are common features to the
   experience.  In particular, the dominant colors of this subjective

    <def> 1. <emphasis>n.</emphasis> The basic unit of

   instruction as taking so many <emphasis>clock
   cycles</emphasis>.  Often the computer can access its memory once on every
   clock cycle, and so one speaks also of <emphasis>memory
   cycles</emphasis>.  These are technical meanings of
   <name>cycle</name>.  The jargon meaning comes from the
   observation that there are only so many cycles per second, and when you are
   sharing a computer the cycles get divided up among the users.  The more
   cycles the computer spends working on your program rather than someone
   else's, the faster your program will run.  That's why every hacker wants
   more cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to respond.
    2. By extension, a notional unit of <emphasis>human</emphasis>
   thought power, emphasizing that lots of things compete for the typical
   hacker's think time.  <italic>I refused to get involved with the Rubik's

    <def> [from Maxwell's Demon, later incorrectly retronymed as &#8216;Disk
   And Execution MONitor&#8217;] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but
   lies dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur.  The idea is that the
   perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking
   (though often a program will commit an action only because it knows that it
   will implicitly invoke a daemon).  For example, under
   <name>ITS</name>, writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory
   would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file.  The
   advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files printed need
   neither compete for access to nor understand any idiosyncrasies of the LPT.
   They simply enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to
   do with them.  Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the system, and
   may either live forever or be regenerated at intervals.Daemon and <name>demon</name> are often used
   interchangeably, but seem to have distinct connotations.  The term
   <emphasis>daemon</emphasis> was introduced to computing by
   <name>CTSS</name> people (who pronounced it <emphasis>/dee´mon/</emphasis>) and used it to refer to
   what ITS called a <name>dragon</name>; the prototype was a
   program called DAEMON that automatically made tape backups of the file
   system.  Although the meaning and the pronunciation have drifted, we think
   this glossary reflects current (2003) usage.</def>

 1. Generic term for a program that assists in debugging other

   Subsequently, the PDP-6, <name>PDP-10</name>,
   <name>PDP-20</name>, <name>PDP-11</name> and

   and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET and Internet machine
   population.  DEC was the technological leader of the minicomputer era
   (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to embrace microcomputers and Unix
   early cost it heavily in profits and prestige after
   <name>silicon</name> got cheap.  Nevertheless, the microprocessor

   OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT) was either genetically

   would activate (which demons depends on the particular piece of data) and
   would create additional pieces of knowledge by applying their respective
   inference rules to the original piece.  These new pieces could in turn

    <def> [also &#8216;demo scene&#8217;] A culture of multimedia hackers
   located primarily in Scandinavia and northern Europe. Demoscene folklore
   recounts that when old-time <name>warez d00dz</name> cracked some
   piece of software they often added an advertisement in the beginning,
   usually containing colorful <name>display hack</name>s with
   greetings to other cracking groups.  The demoscene was born among people
   who decided building these display hacks is more interesting than hacking
   &#8212; or anyway safer.  Around 1990 there began to be very serious police
   pressure on cracking groups, including raids with SWAT teams crashing into
   bedrooms to confiscate computers.  Whether in response to this or for
   esthetic reasons, crackers of that period began to build self-contained
   display hacks of considerable elaboration and beauty (within the culture
   such a hack is called a <name>demo</name>).  As more of these
   <name>demogroup</name>s emerged, they started to have
   <name>compo</name>s at copying parties (see
   <name>copyparty</name>), which later evolved to standalone events
   (see <name>demoparty</name>).  The demoscene has retained some
   traits from the <name>warez d00dz</name>, including their style
   of handles and group names and some of their jargon.Traditionally demos were written in assembly language, with lots of
   smart tricks, self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the like.
   Some time around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and a couple of
   years after that, they also started using Java.Ten years on (in 1998-1999), the demoscene is changing as its
   original platforms (C64, Amiga, Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under DOS) die
   out and activity shifts towards Windows, Linux, and the Internet.  While
   deeply underground in the past, demoscene is trying to get into the
   mainstream as accepted art form, and one symptom of this is the
   commercialization of bigger demoparties. Older demosceners frown at this,
   but the majority think it's a good direction.  Many demosceners end up
   working in the computer game industry.  Demoscene resource pages are
   available at http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/

   glory days of the 1960s, it was &#8216;IBM and the Seven Dwarfs&#8217;:
   Burroughs, Control Data, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and Univac.
   RCA and GE sold out early, and it was &#8216;IBM and the Bunch&#8217;
   (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell) for a while.
   Honeywell was bought out by Bull; Burroughs merged with Univac to form
   Unisys (in 1984 &#8212; this was when the phrase <emphasis>dinosaurs mating</emphasis> was coined); and in 1991
   AT&amp;T absorbed NCR (but spat it back out a few years later). Control
   Data still exists but is no longer in the mainframe business.  In similar
   wave of dinosaur-matings as the PC business began to consolidate after
   1995, Digital Equipment was bought by Compaq which was bought by
   Hewlett-Packard.  More such earth-shaking unions of doomed giants seem

    <def> 1. [now obs.] A security or <name>copy protection</name>
   device for proprietary software consisting of a serialized EPROM and some
   drivers in a D-25 connector shell, which must be connected to an I/O port
   of the computer while the program is run.  Programs that use a dongle query
   the port at startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate
   if it does not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code.  Thus,
   users can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay for
   each dongle.  The first sighting of a dongle was in 1984, associated with a
   software product called PaperClip.  The idea was clever, but it was
   initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this way. By
   1993, dongles would typically pass data through the port and monitor for
   <name>magic</name> codes (and combinations of status lines) with
   minimal if any interference with devices further down the line &#8212; this
   innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained dongles for multiple pieces
   of software.  These devices have become rare as the industry has moved away
   from copy-protection schemes in general.   2. By extension, any physical electronic key or transferable ID
   required for a program to function.  Common variations on this theme have
   used parallel or even joystick ports.  See
   <name>dongle-disk</name>.   3. An adaptor cable mating a special edge-type connector on a PCMCIA
   or on-board Ethernet card to a standard 8p8c Ethernet jack.  This usage
   seems to have surfaced in 1999 and is now dominant.  Laptop owners curse
   these things because they're notoriously easy to lose and the vendors
   commonly charge extortionate prices for replacements.[Note: in early 1992, advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies (a
   manufacturer of dongles) included a claim that the word derived from
   <italic>Don Gall</italic>, allegedly the inventor of the device.  The
   company's receptionist will cheerfully tell you that the story is a myth
   invented for the ad copy.  Nevertheless, I expect it to haunt my life as a

   <name>bucky bits</name> (control and meta shifting keys) were nice, but there
   weren't enough of them; you could type only 512 different characters on a
   Stanford keyboard.  An obvious way to address this was simply to add more
   shifting keys, and this was eventually done; but a keyboard with that many
   shifting keys is hard on touch-typists, who don't like to move their hands
   away from the home position on the keyboard.  It was half-seriously
   suggested that the extra shifting keys be implemented as pedals; typing on
   such a keyboard would be very much like playing a full pipe organ.  This
   idea is mentioned in a parody of a very fine song by Jeffrey Moss called
   Rubber Duckie, which was published in The

    <def> (also <emphasis>mouse on drugs</emphasis>) A malady
   exhibited by the mouse pointing device of some computers.  The typical
   symptom is for the mouse cursor on the screen to move in random directions
   and not in sync with the motion of the actual mouse.  Can usually be
   corrected by unplugging the mouse and plugging it back again.  Another
   recommended fix for optical mice is to rotate your mouse pad 90
   degrees.At Xerox PARC in the 1970s, most people kept a can of copier cleaner
   (isopropyl alcohol) at their desks.  When the steel ball on the mouse had
   picked up enough <name>cruft</name> to be unreliable, the mouse
   was doused in cleaner, which restored it for a while.  However, this
   operation left a fine residue that accelerated the accumulation of cruft,
   so the dousings became more and more frequent.  Finally, the mouse was
   declared &#8216;alcoholic&#8217; and sent to the clinic to be dried out in
   a CFC ultrasonic bath.</def>

   vague, but who nevertheless has the expectation that you will solve the
   problem using the specific method he/she has in mind.Warren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and spelling
   errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and would often make
   hash of anyone else's typos if they were stylistically different.  Some
   victims of DWIM thus claimed that the acronym stood for &#8216;Damn
   Warren&#8217;s Infernal Machine!'.In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the command
   interpreter used at Xerox PARC.  One day another hacker there typed
   delete *$ to free up some disk space.  (The
   editor there named backup files by appending $ to the original file name, so he was trying to
   delete any backup files left over from old editing sessions.)  It happened
   that there weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM helpfully reported
   *$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete
   *'. It then started to delete all the files on the disk!  The
   hacker managed to stop it with a <name>Vulcan nerve pinch</name>
   after only a half dozen or so files were lost.The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go to
   Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his workstation,
   and then type delete *$ twice.DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex
   program; it is also occasionally described as the single instruction the
   ideal computer would have.  Back when proofs of program correctness were in
   vogue, there were also jokes about <emphasis>DWIMC</emphasis> (Do What I Mean, Correctly).  A related

    <def> [AI community] The tendency of humans to attach associations to
   terms from prior experience.  For example, there is nothing magic about the
   symbol + that makes it well-suited to indicate addition;
   it's just that people associate it with addition.  Using
   + or &#8216;plus&#8217; to mean addition in a computer
   language is taking advantage of the ELIZA effect.This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum,
   which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by re­phrasing many of the
   patient's statements as questions and posing them to the patient.  It
   worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution of key words into
   canned phrases.  It was so convincing, however, that there are many
   anecdotes about people becoming very emotionally caught up in dealing with
   ELIZA.  All this was due to people's tendency to attach to words meanings
   which the computer never put there.  The ELIZA effect is a 
   <name>Good Thing</name> when writing a programming language, but it can blind you
   to serious shortcomings when analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system.

    <def> [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus ultra of hacker editors, a
   programmable text editor with an entire LISP system inside it.  It was
   originally written by Richard Stallman in <name>TECO</name> under
   <name>ITS</name> at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554 described it as
   <italic>an advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time
   display editor</italic>.  It has since been reimplemented any number of
   times, by various hackers, and versions exist that run under most major
   operating systems.  Perhaps the most widely used version, also written by
   Stallman and now called <italic>GNU EMACS</italic> or
   <name>GNUMACS</name>, runs principally under Unix.  (Its close
   relative XEmacs is the second most popular version.)  It includes
   facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and receive mail or
   news; many hackers spend up to 80% of their <name>tube
   time</name> inside it.  Other variants include
   <name>GOSMACS</name>, CCA EMACS, UniPress EMACS, Montgomery
   EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS.  (Though we use the original all-caps
   spelling here, it is nowadays very commonly &#8216;Emacs&#8217;.)  Some
   EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an overflowing
   kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the editor does not (yet)
   include.  Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too
   <name>heavyweight</name> and <name>baroque</name> for
   their taste, and expand the name as &#8216;Escape Meta Alt Control
   Shift&#8217; to spoof its heavy reliance on keystrokes decorated with
   <name>bucky bits</name>.  Other spoof expansions include
   &#8216;Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping&#8217; (from when that was a
   lot of <name>core</name>), &#8216;Eventually
   mallocs
   All Computer Storage&#8217;, and &#8216;EMACS Makes A Computer Slow&#8217;

    <def> [common] An ASCII glyph used to indicate an emotional state in email
   or news.  Although originally intended mostly as jokes, emoticons (or some
   other explicit humor indication) are virtually required under certain
   circumstances in high-volume text-only communication forums such as Usenet;
   the lack of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what were intended
   to be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise non-100%-serious comments
   to be badly misinterpreted (not always even by
   <name>newbie</name>s), resulting in arguments and
   <name>flame war</name>s.Hundreds of emoticons have been proposed, but only a few are in
   common use.  These include:   
   :-)&#8216;smiley face&#8217; (for humor,
   laughter, friendliness, occasionally sarcasm)
   :-(&#8216;frowney face&#8217; (for sadness,
   anger, or upset)
   ;-)&#8216;half-smiley&#8217; (
   <name>ha ha only serious</name>); also known as <emphasis>semi-smiley</emphasis> or <emphasis>winkey face</emphasis>.
   :-/&#8216;wry face&#8217; 
     (These may become more comprehensible if you
   tilt your head sideways, to the left.)  The first two listed are by far the
   most frequently encountered.  Hyphenless forms of them are common on
   CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX; see also <name>bixie</name>.  On
   <name>Usenet</name>, <emphasis>smiley</emphasis>
   is often used as a generic term synonymous with
   <name>emoticon</name>, as well as specifically for the happy-face
   emoticon.The invention of the original smiley and frowney emoticons is
   generally credited to Scott Fahlman at CMU in 1982. He later wrote:
   <italic>I wish I had saved the original post, or at least recorded the date
   for posterity, but I had no idea that I was starting something that would
   soon pollute all the world's communication channels.</italic> In September
   2002 the original post  was
   recovered.There is a rival claim by one Kevin McKenzie, who seems to have
   proposed the smiley on the MsgGroup mailing list, April 12 1979.  It seems
   likely these two inventions were independent.  Users of the PLATO
   educational system 
   report using emoticons composed from overlaid dot-matrix graphics
   in the 1970s.Note for the <name>newbie</name>: Overuse of the smiley is
   a mark of loserhood!  More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign
   that you've gone over the line.</def>

    <def> Any of a family of military simulations derived from a game written
   by Peter Langston many years ago.  A number of multi-player variants of
   varying degrees of sophistication exist, and one single-player version
   implemented for both Unix and VMS; the latter is even available as
   MS-DOS/Windows freeware.  All are notoriously addictive.  Of various
   commercial derivatives the best known is probably <italic>Empire
   Deluxe</italic> on PCs and Amigas.Modern empire is a real-time wargame played over the internet by up
   to 120 players. Typical games last from 24 hours (blitz) to a couple of
   months (long term).  The amount of sleep you can get while playing is a
   function of the rate at which updates occur and the number of co-rulers of
   your country.  Empire server software is available for Unix-like machines,
   and clients for Unix and other platforms.  A comprehensive history of the
   game is available at http://www.empire.cx/infopages/History.html.

   Under most Unix versions the epoch is 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970; under
   VMS, it's 00:00:00 of November 17, 1858 (base date of the U.S. Naval
   Observatory's ephemerides); on a Macintosh, it's the midnight beginning
   January 1 1904.  System time is measured in seconds or
   <name>tick</name>s past the epoch.  Weird problems may ensue when
   the clock wraps around (see <name>wrap around</name>), which is
   not necessarily a rare event; on systems counting 10 ticks per second, a

   execution in a switch statement reaches a case label other than by jumping there from the
   switch header, passing a point where one would normally expect to find a
   break.  A trivial example:The variant spelling /* FALL THRU */ is also

    <def> Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on the causation of computer
   glitches.  Your typical electric utility draws its line current out of the

   When the normal tap brushes get dirty, they take them off line to clean
   them up, and use special auxiliary taps on the <emphasis>bottom</emphasis>
   of the coil.  Now, this is a problem, because when they do that they get
   not ordinary or &#8216;thin&#8217; electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy
   electrons that are heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator.
   These flow down ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to turn a
   sharp corner (as in an integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get stuck.
   This is what causes computer glitches.  [Fascinating.  Obviously, fat

    <def> 1. [common] A good property or behavior (as of a program).  Whether
   it was intended or not is immaterial. 2. [common] An intended property or behavior (as of a program).
   Whether it is good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is also a
   <name>misfeature</name>).   3. A surprising property or behavior; in particular, one that is
   purposely inconsistent because it works better that way &#8212; such an
   inconsistency is therefore a <name>feature</name> and not a
   <name>bug</name>.  This kind of feature is sometimes called a
   <name>miswart</name>; see that entry for a classic example.
    4. A property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though
   perhaps also impressive or cute.  For example, one feature of Common LISP's
   format function is the ability to print
   numbers in two different Roman-numeral formats (see 
   <name>bells whistles and gongs</name>).   5. A property or behavior that was put in to help someone else but
   that happens to be in your way.   6. [common] A bug that has been documented.  To call something a
   feature sometimes means the author of the program did not consider the
   particular case, and that the program responded in a way that was
   unexpected but not strictly incorrect.  A standard joke is that a bug can
   be turned into a <name>feature</name> simply by documenting it
   (then theoretically no one can complain about it because it's in the
   manual), or even by simply declaring it to be good.  <italic>That's not a
   bug, that's a feature!</italic> is a common catchphrase.  See also
   <name>feetch feetch</name>, 
   <name>creeping featurism</name>, <name>wart</name>, 
   <name>green lightning</name>.The relationship among bugs, features, misfeatures, warts, and
   miswarts might be clarified by the following hypothetical exchange between
   two hackers on an airliner:A: <italic>This seat doesn't recline.</italic>B: <italic>That's not a bug, that's a feature.  There is an emergency
   exit door built around the window behind you, and the route has to be kept
   clear.</italic>A: <italic>Oh.  Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased the
   spacing between rows here.</italic>B: <italic>Yes.  But if they'd increased spacing in only one section
   it would have been a wart &#8212; they would've had to make
   nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the displaced
   seats.</italic>A: <italic>A miswart, actually.  If they increased spacing throughout
   they'd lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin.  So unequal
   spacing would actually be the Right Thing.</italic>B: <italic>Indeed.</italic><emphasis>Undocumented feature</emphasis> is a
   common, allegedly humorous euphemism for a <name>bug</name>.
   There's a related joke that is sometimes referred to as the

   documentation) the <emphasis>command key</emphasis>. In
   French, the term papillon (butterfly) has
   been reported. The proliferation of terms for this creature may illustrate
   one subtle peril of iconic interfaces.Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that
   appears on the feature key.  Its oldest name is &#8216;cross of St.
   Hannes&#8217;, but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative
   motif.  Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to mark sites
   of historical interest.  Apple picked up the symbol from an early Mac
   developer who happened to be Swedish.  Apple documentation gives the
   translation <italic>interesting feature</italic>!There is some dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this symbol.
   It technically stands for the word
   sevärdhet (thing worth seeing); many of
   these are old churches. Some Swedes report as an idiom for the sign the
   word <emphasis>kyrka</emphasis>, cognate to English
   &#8216;church&#8217; and pronounced (roughly) <emphasis>/chur´ka/</emphasis> in modern Swedish.  Others
   say this is nonsense.  Other idioms reported for the sign are
   runa (rune) or <emphasis>runsten</emphasis> <emphasis>/roon´stn/</emphasis> (runestone), derived from
   the fact that many of the interesting features are Viking rune-stones.  The
   term fornminne <emphasis>/foorn´min'@/</emphasis> (relic of
   antiquity, ancient monument) is also reported, especially among those who
   think that the Mac itself is a relic of antiquity.</def>

    <term>fence</term>
    <def> <emphasis>n.</emphasis>  1. A sequence of one or more distinguished
   (<name>out-of-band</name>) characters (or other data items), used
   to delimit a piece of data intended to be treated as a unit (the
   computer-science literature calls this a <emphasis>sentinel</emphasis>).  The NUL (ASCII 0000000) character
   that terminates strings in C is a fence.  Hex FF is also (though slightly
   less frequently) used this way.  See <name>zigamorph</name>.
    2. An extra data value inserted in an array or other data structure
   in order to allow some normal test on the array's contents also to function
   as a termination test.  For example, a highly optimized routine for finding
   a value in an array might artificially place a copy of the value to be
   searched for after the last slot of the array, thus allowing the main
   search loop to search for the value without having to check at each pass
   whether the end of the array had been reached.   3. [among users of optimizing compilers] Any technique, usually
   exploiting knowledge about the compiler, that blocks certain optimizations.
   Used when explicit mechanisms are not available or are overkill.  Typically
   a hack: <italic>I call a dummy procedure there to force a flush of the

    <def> 1. [common] A problem with the discrete equivalent of a boundary
   condition, often exhibited in programs by iterative loops.  From the
   following problem: <italic>If you build a fence 100 feet long with posts 10
   feet apart, how many posts do you need?</italic> (Either 9 or 11 is a better
   answer than the obvious 10.)  For example, suppose you have a long list or
   array of items, and want to process items
   m through
   n; how many items are there?  The obvious
   answer is n - m, but that is off by one;
   the right answer is n - m + 1.  A program
   that used the &#8216;obvious&#8217; formula would have a fencepost error in
   it.  See also <name>zeroth</name> and 
   <name>off-by-one error</name>, and note that not all off-by-one errors are fencepost
   errors.  The game of Musical Chairs involves a catastrophic off-by-one
   error where N people try to sit in
   N - 1 chairs, but it's not a fencepost
   error.  Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces
   between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one
   should count one or both ends of a row.   2. [rare] An error induced by unexpected regularities in input
   values, which can (for instance) completely thwart a theoretically
   efficient binary tree or hash table implementation.  (The error here
   involves the difference between expected and worst case behaviors of an
   algorithm.)</def>

   sure that the users can't do any damage. Since users always want to be able

   <name>xyzzy</name>, <name>thud</name>.When &#8216;foo&#8217; is used in connection with &#8216;bar&#8217;
   it has generally traced to the WWII-era Army slang acronym
   <name>FUBAR</name> (&#8216;Fucked Up Beyond All Repair&#8217; or
   &#8216;Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition&#8217;), later modified to
   <name>foobar</name>.  Early versions of the Jargon File
   interpreted this change as a post-war bowdlerization, but it it now seems
   more likely that FUBAR was itself a derivative of &#8216;foo&#8217; perhaps
   influenced by German furchtbar (terrible)
   &#8212; &#8216;foobar&#8217; may actually have been the
   <emphasis>original</emphasis> form.For, it seems, the word &#8216;foo&#8217; itself had an immediate
   prewar history in comic strips and cartoons.  The earliest documented uses
   were in the Smokey Stover comic strip published from
   about 1930 to about 1952.  Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled it
   with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other nonsense phrases
   such as <italic>Notary Sojac</italic> and <italic>1506 nix nix</italic>.  The
   word <italic>foo</italic> frequently appeared on license plates of cars, in
   nonsense sayings in the background of some frames (such as <italic>He who
   foos last foos best</italic> or <italic>Many smoke but foo men chew</italic>),
   and Holman had Smokey say <italic>Where there's foo, there's
   fire</italic>.According to the 
   Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion Holman claimed to have found the
   word <italic>foo</italic> on the bottom of a Chinese figurine.  This is
   plausible; Chinese statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions, and this
   one was almost certainly the Mandarin Chinese word
   fu (sometimes transliterated
   foo), which can mean
   <italic>happiness</italic> or <italic>prosperity</italic> when spoken with the
   rising tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese
   restaurants are properly called <italic>fu dogs</italic>).  English speakers'
   reception of Holman's &#8216;foo&#8217; nonsense word was undoubtedly
   influenced by Yiddish &#8216;feh&#8217; and English &#8216;fooey&#8217; and
   &#8216;fool&#8217;.Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode on
   two wheels.  The comic strip was tremendously popular in the late 1930s,
   and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even produced an operable
   version of Holman's Foomobile.  According to the Encyclopedia of American
   Comics, &#8216;Foo&#8217; fever swept the U.S., finding its way into
   popular songs and generating over 500 &#8216;Foo Clubs.&#8217; The fad left
   &#8216;foo&#8217; references embedded in popular culture (including a
   couple of appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons of 1938-39; notably in
   Robert Clampett's <italic>Daffy Doc</italic> of 1938, in which a very early
   version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying <italic>SILENCE IS
   FOO!</italic>) When the fad faded, the origin of <italic>foo</italic> was
   forgotten.One place <italic>foo</italic> is known to have remained live is in the
   U.S. military during the WWII years.  In 1944-45, the term &#8216;foo
   fighters&#8217; was in use by radar operators for the kind of mysterious or
   spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the older term resurfaced
   in popular American usage in 1995 via the name of one of the better
   grunge-rock bands).  Because informants connected the term directly to the
   Smokey Stover strip, the folk etymology that connects it to French
   <italic>feu</italic> (fire) can be gently dismissed.The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms during
   the war (see <name>kluge</name> and <name>kludge</name>
   for another important example) Period sources reported that
   &#8216;FOO&#8217; became a semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army
   graffiti more or less equivalent to the American Kilroy.  Where British
   troops went, the graffito <italic>FOO was here</italic> or something similar
   showed up.  Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from
   Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous
   <italic>FUBAR</italic>) was probably a <name>backronym</name> .
   Forty years later, Paul Dickson's excellent book <italic>Words</italic>
   (Dell, 1982, ISBN 0-440-52260-7) traced <italic>Foo</italic> to an
   unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:
   <italic>Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with bitter
   omniscience and sarcasm.</italic>Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that hacker
   usage actually sprang from FOO, Lampoons and Parody,
   the title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint project
   of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens)
   later became one of the most important and influential artists in
   underground comics, this venture was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers
   later burned most of the existing copies in disgust.  The title FOO was
   featured in large letters on the front cover.  However, very few copies of
   this comic actually circulated, and students of Crumb's
   oeuvre have established that this title was
   a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover comics.  The Crumbs may also have
   been influenced by a short-lived Canadian parody magazine named
   &#8216;Foo&#8217; published in 1951-52.An old-time member reports that in the 1959 Dictionary of
   the TMRC Language, compiled at <name>TMRC</name>,
   there was an entry that went something like this:(For more about the legendary foo counters, see
   <name>TMRC</name>.)  This definition used Bill Holman's nonsense
   word, then only two decades old and demonstrably still live in popular
   culture and slang, to a <name>ha ha only serious</name> analogy
   with esoteric Tibetan Buddhism.  Today's hackers would find it difficult to
   resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not likely 1959's were any
   less susceptible. Almost the entire staff of what later became the MIT AI
   Lab was involved with TMRC, and the word spread from there.</def>

    <def> 1. The <name>PDP-10</name> successor that was to have been

   Laboratory along with a new operating system.  (The name itself came from
   FOO NLI, an error message emitted by a PDP-10 assembler at SAIL meaning
   <italic>FOO is Not a Legal Identifier</italic>.  The intention was to
   leapfrog from the old <name>DEC</name> timesharing system SAIL
   was then running to a new generation, bypassing TENEX which at that time
   was the ARPANET standard.  ARPA funding for both the Super Foonly and the
   new operating system was cut in 1974.  Most of the design team went to DEC
   and contributed greatly to the design of the PDP-10 model KL10.   2. The name of the company formed by Dave Poole, one of the
   principal Super Foonly designers, and one of hackerdom's more colorful
   personalities.  Many people remember the parrot which sat on Poole's
   shoulder and was a regular companion. 3. Any of the machines built by Poole's company.  The first was the
   F-1 (a.k.a.  Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used to
   create the graphics in the movie TRON.  The F-1 was
   the fastest PDP-10 ever built, but only one was ever made.  The effort
   drained Foonly of its financial resources, and the company turned towards
   building smaller, slower, and much less expensive machines.  Unfortunately,
   these ran not the popular <name>TOPS-20</name> but a TENEX
   variant called Foonex; this seriously limited their market.  Also, the
   machines shipped were actually wire-wrapped engineering prototypes
   requiring individual attention from more than usually competent site
   personnel, and thus had significant reliability problems.  Poole's
   legendary temper and unwillingness to suffer fools gladly did not help
   matters.  By the time DEC's <italic>Jupiter Project</italic> followon to the
   PDP-10 was cancelled in 1983, Foonly's proposal to build another F-1 was
   eclipsed by the <name>Mars</name>, and the company never quite

   should not be confused with a development branch, which may later be folded
   back into the original source code base.  Nor should it be confused with
   what happens when a new distribution of Linux or some other distribution is
   created, because that largely assembles pieces than can and will be used in
   other distributions without conflict.Forking is uncommon; in fact, it is so uncommon that individual
   instances loom large in hacker folklore.  Notable in this class were the
   Emacs/XEmacs fork, the GCC/EGCS fork (later healed by a merger) and the

    <def> 1. [common after 1997, esp. in the Linux community] An open-source
   software project is said to have forked or be forked when the project group
   fissions into two or more parts pursuing separate lines of development (or,
   less commonly, when a third party unconnected to the project group begins
   its own line of development).  Forking is considered a 
   <name>Bad Thing</name> &#8212; not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort
   in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of
   strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy,
   succession, and design direction.  There is serious social pressure against
   forking.  As a result, major forks (such as the Gnu-Emacs/XEmacs split, the
   fissionings of the 386BSD group into three daughter projects, and the
   short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered
   individually in hacker folklore.   2. [Unix; uncommon; prob.: influenced by a mainstream expletive]

    <def> As defined by Richard M. Stallman and used by the Free Software
   movement, this means software that gives users enough freedom to be used by
   the free software community.  Specifically, users must be free to modify
   the software for their private use, and free to redistribute it either with
   or without modifications, either commercially or noncommercially, either
   gratis or charging a distribution fee.  Free software has existed since the
   dawn of computing; Free Software as a movement began in 1984 with the GNU
   Project.RMS observes that the English word <italic>free</italic> can refer
   either to liberty (where it means the same as the Spanish or French
   <italic>libre</italic>) or to price (where it means the same as the Spanish
   <italic>gratis</italic> or French <italic>gratuit</italic>).  RMS and other
   people associated with the FSF like to explain the word <italic>free</italic>
   in <italic>free software</italic> by saying <italic>Free as in speech, not as
   in beer.</italic>See also <name>open source</name>.  Hard-core proponents of
   the term <italic>free software</italic> sometimes reject this newer term,
   claiming that the style of argument associated with it ignores or downplays

    <def> [obs.] Abbreviation for <italic>Freely Redistributable

   years of low-level confusion over what exactly to call software written to
   be passed around and shared (contending terms including
   <name>freeware</name>, <name>shareware</name>, and
   <emphasis>sourceware</emphasis> were never universally
   felt to be satisfactory for various subtle reasons).  The first formal
   conference on freely redistributable software was held in Cambridge,
   Massachussetts, in February 1996 (sponsored by the Free Software
   Foundation). The conference organizers used the FRS abbreviation heavily in
   its calls for papers and other literature during 1995. The term was in
   steady though not common use until 1998 and the invention of
   <name>open source</name>, after which it became swiftly

   <italic>FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people
   instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering
   [Amdahl] products.</italic> The idea, of course, was to persuade them to go
   with safe IBM gear rather than with competitors' equipment.  This implicit
   coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would
   happen to people who stuck with IBM, but Dark Shadows loomed over the
   future of competitors' equipment or software.  See
   <name>IBM</name>.  After 1990 the term FUD was associated
   increasingly frequently with <name>Microsoft</name>, and has
   become generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation used as a
   competitive weapon.[In 2003, SCO sued IBM in an action which, among other things,
   alleged SCO's proprietary control of <name>Linux</name>.  The SCO
   suit rapidly became infamous for the number and magnitude of falsehoods
   alleged in SCO's filings.  In October 2003, SCO's lawyers filed a memorandum
   in which they actually had the temerity to link to the web version of
   <emphasis>this entry</emphasis> in furtherance of their claims. Whilst we
   appreciate the compliment of being treated as an authority, we can return
   it only by observing that SCO has become a nest of liars and thieves

   how large it needs to be, and it is better to waste a little space than to
   lose completely for not having enough.  A fudge factor, on the other hand,
   can often be tweaked in more than one direction.  A good example is the
   <emphasis>fuzz</emphasis> typically allowed in
   floating-point calculations: two numbers being compared for equality must
   be allowed to differ by a small amount; if that amount is too small, a
   computation may never terminate, while if it is too large, results will be

    <def> Ungrounded; impractical; not well-thought-out; untried;
   untested.&#8216;Gedanken&#8217; is a German word for &#8216;thought&#8217;.  A
   thought experiment is one you carry out in your head.  In physics, the term
   gedanken experiment is used to refer to an
   experiment that is impractical to carry out, but useful to consider because
   it can be reasoned about theoretically.  (A classic gedanken experiment of
   relativity theory involves thinking about a man in an elevator accelerating
   through space.)  Gedanken experiments are very useful in physics, but must
   be used with care.  It's too easy to idealize away some important aspect of
   the real world in constructing the &#8216;apparatus&#8217;.Among hackers, accordingly, the word has a pejorative connotation.
   It is typically used of a project, especially one in artificial
   intelligence research, that is written up in grand detail (typically as a
   Ph.D.  thesis) without ever being implemented to any great extent.  Such a
   project is usually perpetrated by people who aren't very good hackers or
   find programming distasteful or are just in a hurry.  A <emphasis>gedanken thesis</emphasis> is usually marked by an obvious
   lack of intuition about what is programmable and what is not, and about

    <def> A person who has chosen concentration rather than conformity; one
   who pursues skill (especially technical skill) and imagination, not
   mainstream social acceptance.  Geeks usually have a strong case of
   <name>neophilia</name>. Most geeks are adept with computers and
   treat <name>hacker</name> as a term of respect, but not all are
   hackers themselves &#8212; and some who <emphasis>are</emphasis> in fact
   hackers normally call themselves geeks anyway, because they (quite
   properly) regard &#8216;hacker&#8217; as a label that should be bestowed by
   others rather than self-assumed.One 
   description accurately if a little breathlessly enumerates
   <italic>gamers, ravers, science fiction fans, punks, perverts, programmers,
   nerds, subgenii, and trekkies. These are people who did not go to their
   high school proms, and many would be offended by the suggestion that they
   should have even wanted to.</italic>Originally, a <emphasis>geek</emphasis> was a
   carnival performer who bit the heads off chickens.  (In early 20th-century
   Scotland a &#8216;geek&#8217; was an immature coley, a type of fish.)
   Before about 1990 usage of this term was rather negative.  Earlier versions
   of this lexicon defined a <emphasis>computer
   geek</emphasis> as one who eats (computer) bugs for a living &#8212; an
   asocial, malodorous, pasty-faced monomaniac with all the personality of a
   cheese grater.  This is often still the way geeks are regarded by
   non-geeks, but as the mainstream culture becomes more dependent on
   technology and technical skill mainstream attitudes have tended to shift
   towards grudging respect.  Correspondingly, there are now &#8216;geek
   pride&#8217; festivals (the implied reference to &#8216;gay pride&#8217; is
   not accidental).See also <name>propeller head</name>,

    <def> 1. [acronym: &#8216;GNU&#8217;s Not Unix!', see <name>recursive
   acronym</name>] A Unix-workalike development effort of the Free
   Software Foundation headed by Richard Stallman.  GNU EMACS and the GNU C
   compiler, two tools designed for this project, have become very popular in
   hackerdom and elsewhere.  The GNU project was designed partly to
   proselytize for RMS's position that information is community property and
   all software source should be shared.  One of its slogans is <italic>Help
   stamp out software hoarding!</italic> Though this remains controversial
   (because it implicitly denies any right of designers to own, assign, and
   sell the results of their labors), many hackers who disagree with RMS have
   nevertheless cooperated to produce large amounts of high-quality software
   for free redistribution under the Free Software Foundation's imprimatur.
   The GNU project has a web page at http://www.gnu.org/.  See

    <def> [obs.] A type of Internet service first floated around 1991 and

   interface to a tree or graph of links; the links can be to documents,
   runnable programs, or other gopher menus arbitrarily far across the
   net.Some claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed
   at the University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota Gophers (a

   <italic>go fer</italic>), one whose job is to run and fetch things.  Finally,
   observe that gophers dig long tunnels, and the idea of tunneling through
   the net to find information was a defining metaphor for the developers.
   Probably all three things were true, but with the first two coming first
   and the gopher-tunnel metaphor serendipitously adding flavor and impetus to

    <def> A mythical accessory to a terminal.  A crank on the side of a

   to run faster.  Usually one does not refer to a grind crank out loud, but
   merely makes the appropriate gesture and noise.  See
   <name>grind</name>.Historical note: At least one real machine actually had a grind crank
   &#8212; the R1, a research machine built toward the end of the days of the
   great vacuum tube computers, in 1959.  R1 (also known as &#8216;The Rice
   Institute Computer&#8217; (TRIC) and later as &#8216;The Rice University
   Computer&#8217; (TRUC)) had a single-step/free-run switch for use when
   debugging programs.  Since single-stepping through a large program was
   rather tedious, there was also a crank with a cam and gear arrangement that
   repeatedly pushed the single-step button.  This allowed one to
   &#8216;crank&#8217; through a lot of code, then slow down to single-step
   for a bit when you got near the code of interest, poke at some registers
   using the console typewriter, and then keep on cranking.  See http://www.cs.rice.edu/History/R1/.</def>

   tempered by its extreme fear of light. No grues have ever been seen by the
   light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground
   lairs. Of those who have seen grues, few have survived their fearsome jaws
   to tell the tale. Grues have sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed faces, sharp

   &#8216;gweep&#8217; was the sound of the Datapoint's bell (compare

    <def> [from SF fandom] A method of &#8216;marking&#8217; common words,

   catchphrase <italic>Bheer is the One True Ghod!</italic> from decades ago.
   H-infix marking of &#8216;Ghod&#8217; and other words spread into the 1960s
   counterculture via underground comix, and into early hackerdom either from
   the counterculture or from SF fandom (the three overlapped heavily at the
   time).  More recently, the h infix has become an expected feature of

   are constructed on in-joke and self-parody.  This lexicon contains many
   examples of ha-ha-only-serious in both form and content.  Indeed, the

   <emphasis>deep hack mode</emphasis>.Being yanked out of hack mode (see

   sensation of being in hack mode is more than a little habituating.  The

   for the existence of hackers, and explains why many resist being promoted
   out of positions where they can code.  See also
   <name>cyberspace</name> (sense 3).Some aspects of hacker etiquette will appear quite odd to an observer
   unaware of the high value placed on hack mode.  For example, if someone
   appears at your door, it is perfectly okay to hold up a hand (without
   turning one's eyes away from the screen) to avoid being interrupted.  One
   may read, type, and interact with the computer for quite some time before
   further acknowledging the other's presence (of course, he or she is
   reciprocally free to leave without a word).  The understanding is that you

    <def> [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]  1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems
   and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer
   to learn only the minimum necessary.  RFC1392, the Internet
   Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who
   delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a
   system, computers and computer networks in particular. 2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who
   enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.   3. A person capable of appreciating 
   <name>hack value</name>.   4. A person who is good at programming quickly.   5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does
   work using it or on it; as in &#8216;a Unix hacker&#8217;.  (Definitions 1
   through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)   6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One might be an astronomy
   hacker, for example.   7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively
   overcoming or circumventing limitations.   8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive
   information by poking around.  Hence <emphasis>password
   hacker</emphasis>, <emphasis>network hacker</emphasis>.
   The correct term for this sense is <name>cracker</name>.The term &#8216;hacker&#8217; also tends to connote membership in the
   global community defined by the net (see 
   <name>the network</name>.  For discussion of some of the basics of this culture,
   see the  How
   To Become A Hacker FAQ. It also implies that the person described
   is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic (see
   <name>hacker ethic</name>).It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
   oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a
   meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly
   welcome.  There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying
   yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll
   quickly be labeled <name>bogus</name>).  See also

   the hacker culture surrounding TMRC and the MIT AI Lab.  We have a report

   electronics tinkerers in the mid-1950s.</def>

    <def> 1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good,
   and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by
   writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to
   computing resources wherever possible.   2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is
   ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach
   of confidentiality.Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no
   means universally, accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the
   hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away
   open-source software.  A few go further and assert that
   <emphasis>all</emphasis> information should be free and
   <emphasis>any</emphasis> proprietary control of it is bad; this is the
   philosophy behind the <name>GNU</name> project.Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
   cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.  But the
   belief that &#8216;ethical&#8217; cracking excludes destruction at least
   moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as &#8216;benign&#8217;
   crackers (see also <name>samurai</name>, <name>gray
   hat</name>).  On this view, it may be one of the highest forms of
   hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the
   sysop, preferably by email from a <name>superuser</name> account,
   exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged &#8212; acting as
   an unpaid (and unsolicited) <name>tiger team</name>.The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic
   is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks,
   software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers.
   Huge cooperative networks such as <name>Usenet</name>,
   <name>FidoNet</name> and the Internet itself can function without
   central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a
   sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible

    <term>hacker humor</term>
    <def> A distinctive style of shared intellectual humor found among
   hackers, having the following marked characteristics:1. Fascination with form-vs.-content jokes, paradoxes, and humor
   having to do with confusion of metalevels (see
   <name>meta</name>).  One way to make a hacker laugh: hold a red
   index card in front of him/her with <italic>GREEN</italic> written on it, or
   vice-versa (note, however, that this is funny only the first time).2. Elaborate deadpan parodies of large intellectual constructs, such
   as specifications (see <name>write-only memory</name>), standards
   documents, language descriptions (see <name>INTERCAL</name>), and
   even entire scientific theories (see 
   <name>quantum bogodynamics</name>, <name>computron</name>).3. Jokes that involve screwily precise reasoning from bizarre,
   ludicrous, or just grossly counter-intuitive premises.4. Fascination with puns and wordplay.5. A fondness for apparently mindless humor with subversive currents
   of intelligence in it &#8212; for example, old Warner Brothers and Rocky
   &amp; Bullwinkle cartoons, the Marx brothers, the early B-52s, and Monty
   Python's Flying Circus.  Humor that combines this trait with elements of
   high camp and slapstick is especially favored.6. References to the symbol-object antinomies and associated ideas in
   Zen Buddhism and (less often) Taoism.  See

    <def> MIT AI Memo 239 (February 1972).  A legendary collection of neat
   mathematical and programming hacks contributed by many people at MIT and
   elsewhere.  (The title of the memo really is <italic>HAKMEM</italic>, which
   is a 6-letterism for &#8216;hacks memo&#8217;.)  Some of them are very
   useful techniques, powerful theorems, or interesting unsolved problems, but
   most fall into the category of mathematical and computer trivia.  Here is a
   sampling of the entries (with authors), slightly paraphrased:Item 41 (Gene Salamin): There are exactly 23,000 prime numbers less
   than
   218.Item 46 (Rich Schroeppel): The most <emphasis>probable</emphasis>
   suit distribution in bridge hands is 4-4-3-2, as compared to 4-3-3-3, which
   is the most <emphasis>evenly</emphasis> distributed.  This is because the
   world likes to have unequal numbers: a thermodynamic effect saying things
   will not be in the state of lowest energy, but in the state of lowest
   disordered energy.Item 81 (Rich Schroeppel): Count the magic squares of order 5 (that
   is, all the 5-by-5 arrangements of the numbers from 1 to 25 such that all
   rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number).  There are about
   320 million, not counting those that differ only by rotation and
   reflection.Item 154 (Bill Gosper): The myth that any given programming language
   is machine independent is easily exploded by computing the sum of powers of
   2.  If the result loops with period = 1
   with sign +, you are on a sign-magnitude
   machine.  If the result loops with period =
   1 at -1, you are on a
   twos-complement machine.  If the result loops with period greater than 1,
   including the beginning, you are on a ones-complement machine.  If the
   result loops with period greater than 1, not including the beginning, your
   machine isn't binary &#8212; the pattern should tell you the base.  If you
   run out of memory, you are on a string or bignum system.  If arithmetic
   overflow is a fatal error, some fascist pig with a read-only mind is trying
   to enforce machine independence.  But the very ability to trap overflow is
   machine dependent.  By this strategy, consider the universe, or, more
   precisely, algebra: Let X = the sum of
   many powers of 2 = ...111111 (base 2).  Now add
   X to itself: X + X
   = ...111110.  Thus, 2X = X -
   1, so X = -1.  Therefore
   algebra is run on a machine (the universe) that is two's-complement.Item 174 (Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson): 21963283741 is the only
   number such that if you represent it on the <name>PDP-10</name>
   as both an integer and a floating-point number, the bit patterns of the two
   representations are identical.Item 176 (Gosper): The <italic>banana phenomenon</italic> was
   encountered when processing a character string by taking the last 3 letters
   typed out, searching for a random occurrence of that sequence in the text,
   taking the letter following that occurrence, typing it out, and iterating.
   This ensures that every 4-letter string output occurs in the original.  The
   program typed BANANANANANANANA.... We note an ambiguity in the
   phrase, <italic>the Nth occurrence
   of.</italic> In one sense, there are five 00's in 0000000000; in another,
   there are nine.  The editing program TECO finds five.  Thus it finds only
   the first ANA in BANANA, and is thus obligated to type N next.  By Murphy's
   Law, there is but one NAN, thus forcing A, and thus a loop.  An option to
   find overlapped instances would be useful, although it would require
   backing up N &#8722; 1 characters before
   seeking the next N-character
   string.Note: This last item refers to a 
   <name>Dissociated Press</name> implementation.  See also 
   <name>banana problem</name>.HAKMEM also contains some rather more complicated mathematical and
   technical items, but these examples show some of its fun flavor.An HTML transcription of the entire document is available at http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hakmem.html.</def>

    <def> A shorthand method of spelling found on many British academic
   bulletin boards and <name>talker system</name>s.  Syllables and
   whole words in a sentence are replaced by single ASCII characters the names
   of which are phonetically similar or equivalent, while multiple letters are
   usually dropped.  Hence, &#8216;for&#8217; becomes &#8216;4&#8217;;
   &#8216;two&#8217;, &#8216;too&#8217;, and &#8216;to&#8217; become
   &#8216;2&#8217;; &#8216;ck&#8217; becomes &#8216;k&#8217;.  <italic>Before I
   see you tomorrow</italic> becomes <italic>b4 i c u 2moro</italic>.  First
   appeared in London about 1986, and was probably caused by the slowness of
   available talker systems, which operated on archaic machines with outdated
   operating systems and no standard methods of communication.Hakspek almost disappeared after the great bandwidth explosion of the
   early 1990s, as fast Internet links wiped out the old-style talker systems.
   However, it has enjoyed a revival in another medium &#8212; the Short Message
   Service (SMS) associated with GSM cellphones.  SMS sends are limited to a
   maximum of 160 characters, and typing on a cellphone keypad is difficult
   and slow anyway.  There are now even published paper dictionaries for SMS
   users to help them do hakspek-to-English and vice-versa.See also <name>talk mode</name>.</def>

   Network and BBS handles function as the same sort of simultaneous

   term was adopted.  Use of grandiose handles is characteristic of

   numeric index into some array somewhere, through which you can manipulate
   an object like a file or window.  The form <emphasis>file
   handle</emphasis> is especially common.  3. [Mac] A pointer to a pointer to dynamically-allocated memory; the
   extra level of indirection allows on-the-fly memory compaction (to cut down
   on fragmentation) or aging out of unused resources, with minimal impact on
   the (possibly multiple) parts of the larger program containing references

   <italic>Boy, what a handwave!</italic>If someone starts a sentence with <italic>Clearly...</italic> or
   <italic>Obviously...</italic> or <italic>It is self-evident
   that...</italic>, it is a good bet he is about to handwave
   (alternatively, use of these constructions in a sarcastic tone before a
   paraphrase of someone else's argument suggests that it is a handwave).  The
   theory behind this term is that if you wave your hands at the right moment,
   the listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that what you
   have said is <name>bogus</name>.  Failing that, if a listener
   does object, you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave of your
   hand.The use of this word is often accompanied by gestures: both hands up,
   palms forward, swinging the hands in a vertical plane pivoting at the
   elbows and/or shoulders (depending on the magnitude of the handwave);
   alternatively, holding the forearms in one position while rotating the
   hands at the wrist to make them flutter.  In context, the gestures alone
   can suffice as a remark; if a speaker makes an outrageously unsupported
   assumption, you might simply wave your hands in this way, as an accusation,
   far more eloquent than words could express, that his logic is
   faulty.</def>

   &#8216;denary&#8217;, which comes from &#8216;deni&#8217; (ten at a time,
   ten each), a Latin <emphasis>distributive</emphasis>
   number; the corresponding term for base-16 would be something like

   <emphasis>sedecim</emphasis>, Latin for 16. Ergo,
   <emphasis>sedecimal</emphasis> is the word that would have

    <def> A software or hardware feature included in order to simplify later

   would let a variable determine what base to use; setting the variable to 5
   would make the program print numbers in base 5.  The variable is a simple
   hook.  An even more flexible program might examine the variable and treat a
   value of 16 or less as the base to use, but treat any other number as the
   address of a user-supplied routine for printing a number.  This is a
   <name>hairy</name> but powerful hook; one can then write a
   routine to print numbers as Roman numerals, say, or as Hebrew characters,
   and plug it into the program through the hook.  Often the difference
   between a good program and a superb one is that the latter has useful hooks
   in judiciously chosen places.  Both may do the original job about equally

   difficulties crashed, and it was announced to have been hosed.  It was
   discovered that the crash was due to the disconnection of some coolant
   hoses.  The problem was corrected, and users were then assured that

    <def> 1. [primarily used by C/Unix programmers, but spreading] It is
   received wisdom that in most programs, less than 10% of the code eats 90%
   of the execution time; if one were to graph instruction visits versus code
   addresses, one would typically see a few huge spikes amidst a lot of
   low-level noise.  Such spikes are called <emphasis>hot
   spots</emphasis> and are good candidates for heavy optimization or
   <name>hand-hacking</name>.  The term is especially used of tight
   loops and recursions in the code's central algorithm, as opposed to (say)
   initial set-up costs or large but infrequent I/O operations.  See
   <name>tune</name>, <name>hand-hacking</name>.   2. The active location of a cursor on a bit-map display.  <italic>Put
   the mouse's hot spot on the &#8216;ON&#8217; widget and click the left

   <name>canonical</name> examples; WWW browsers present hypertext
   links as hot spots which, when clicked on, point the browser at another
   document (these are specifically called
   <name>hotlink</name>s). 4. In a massively parallel computer with shared memory, the one
   location that all 10,000 processors are trying to read or write at once
   (perhaps because they are all doing a <name>busy-wait</name> on
   the same lock).   5. More generally, any place in a hardware design that turns into a
   performance bottleneck due to resource contention.</def>

   today, the one they are most puzzled to find themselves liking.From hackerdom's beginnings in the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, IBM
   was regarded with active loathing.  Common expansions of the corporate name
   included: Inferior But Marketable; It's Better Manually; Insidious Black
   Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning; Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a
   near-<name>infinite</name> number of even less complimentary
   expansions (see also <name>fear and loathing</name>).  What
   galled hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level wasn't so much
   that they were underpowered and overpriced (though that counted against
   them), but that the designs were incredibly archaic,
   <name>crufty</name>, and <name>elephantine</name>
   ... and you couldn't <emphasis>fix</emphasis> them &#8212; source
   code was locked up tight, and programming tools were expensive, hard to
   find, and bletcherous to use once you had found them.We didn't know how good we had it back then.  In the 1980s IBM had
   its own troubles with Microsoft and lost its strategic way, receding from
   the hacker community's view.  Then, in the 1990s, Microsoft became more
   noxious and omnipresent than IBM had ever been.In the late 1990s IBM re-invented itself as a services company, began
   to release open-source software through its AlphaWorks group, and began
   shipping <name>Linux</name> systems and building ties to the
   Linux community.  To the astonishment of all parties, IBM emerged as a
   staunch friend of the hacker community and 
   <name>open source</name> development, with ironic consequences
   noted in the <name>FUD</name> entry.This lexicon includes a number of entries attributed to

    <def> [C, C++, and Java programmers] The rules one uses to indent code in
   a readable fashion.  There are four major C indent styles, described below;
   all have the aim of making it easier for the reader to visually track the
   scope of control constructs.  They have been inherited by C++ and Java,
   which have C-like syntaxes.  The significant variable is the placement of
   { and } with respect to the
   statement(s) they enclose and to the guard or controlling statement
   (if, else,
   for, while,
   or do) on the block, if any.<emphasis>K&amp;R style</emphasis> &#8212; Named
   after Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, because the examples in <name>K&amp;R</name> are formatted this way.  Also
   called <emphasis>kernel style</emphasis> because the Unix
   kernel is written in it, and the &#8216;One True Brace Style&#8217;
   (abbrev. 1TBS) by its partisans.  In C code, the body is typically indented
   by eight spaces (or one tab) per level, as shown here. Four spaces are
   occasionally seen in C, but in C++ and Java four tends to be the rule
   rather than the exception.<emphasis>Allman style</emphasis> &#8212; Named for
   Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who wrote a lot of the BSD utilities in it
   (it is sometimes called <emphasis>BSD style</emphasis>).
   Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and Algol.  It is the only style
   other than K&amp;R in widespread use among Java programmers. Basic indent
   per level shown here is eight spaces, but four (or sometimes three) spaces
   are generally preferred by C++ and Java programmers.<emphasis>Whitesmiths style</emphasis> &#8212;
   popularized by the examples that came with Whitesmiths C, an early
   commercial C compiler.  Basic indent per level shown here is eight spaces,
   but four spaces are occasionally seen.<emphasis>GNU style</emphasis> &#8212; Used
   throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software Foundation code, and just about
   nowhere else.  Indents are always four spaces per level, with { and } halfway
   between the outer and inner indent levels.Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most
   common, with about equal mind shares.  K&amp;R/1TBS used to be nearly
   universal, but is now much less common in C (the opening brace tends to get
   lost against the right paren of the guard part in an if or while, which
   is a <name>Bad Thing</name>).  Defenders of 1TBS argue that any
   putative gain in readability is less important than their style's relative
   economy with vertical space, which enables one to see more code on one's
   screen at once.  The Java Language Specification legislates not only the
   capitalization of identifiers, but where nouns, adjectives, and verbs
   should be in method, class, interface, and variable names (section
   6.8). While the specification stops short of also standardizing on a
   bracing style, all source code originating from Sun Laboratories uses the
   K&amp;R style.  This has set a precedent for Java programmers, which most
   follow.Doubtless these issues will continue to be the subject of
   <name>holy wars</name>.</def>

    <def> It is common lore among hackers (and in the electronics industry at
   large; this term is possibly techspeak by now) that the chances of sudden
   hardware failure drop off exponentially with a machine's time since first
   use (that is, until the relatively distant time at which enough mechanical
   wear in I/O devices and thermal-cycling stress in components has
   accumulated for the machine to start going senile).  Up to half of all chip
   and wire failures happen within a new system's first few weeks; such
   failures are often referred to as <emphasis>infant
   mortality</emphasis> problems (or, occasionally, as <emphasis>sudden infant death syndrome</emphasis>).  See

    <def> <italic>If you put an infinite number of
   monkeys at typewriters, eventually one will bash out the script for
   Hamlet.</italic> (One may also hypothesize a small number of monkeys and a
   very long period of time.)  This theorem asserts nothing about the
   intelligence of the one <name>random</name> monkey that
   eventually comes up with the script (and note that the mob will also type
   out all the possible <emphasis>incorrect</emphasis> versions of Hamlet).
   It may be referred to semi-seriously when justifying a <name>brute
   force</name> method; the implication is that, with enough resources
   thrown at it, any technical challenge becomes a <name>one-banana
   problem</name>.  This argument gets more respect since
   <name>Linux</name> justified the <name>bazaar</name>
   mode of development.Other hackers maintain that the Infinite-Monkey Theorem cannot be
   true &#8212; otherwise Usenet would have reproduced the entire canon of
   great literature by now.In mid-2002, researchers at Plymouth Univesity in England actually
   put a working computer in a cage with six crested macaques.  The monkeys
   proceeded to bash the machine with a rock, urinate on it, and type the
   letter S a lot (later, the letters A, J, L, and M also crept in).  The
   results were published in a limited-edition book, Notes Towards
   The Complete Works of Shakespeare. A researcher reported:
   <italic>They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when
   they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention
   there.</italic> Scattered field reports that there are AOL users this
   competent have been greeted with well-deserved skepticism.This theorem has been traced to the mathematiciamn Émile
   Borel in 1913, and was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur
   Eddington.  It became part of the idiom of techies via the classic SF short
   story Inflexible
   Logic by Russell Maloney, and many younger hackers know it through
   a reference in Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy.  Some other references have been collected
   on the Web.
   On 1 April 2000 the usage acquired its own Internet standard,  RFC2795 (Infinite Monkey
   Protocol Suite).</def>

    <def> The mother of all networks.  First incarnated beginning in 1969 as
   the ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense research testbed.  Though it has
   been widely believed that the goal was to develop a network architecture
   for military command-and-control that could survive disruptions up to and
   including nuclear war, this is a myth; in fact, ARPANET was conceived from
   the start as a way to get most economical use out of then-scarce
   large-computer resources.  Robert Herzfeld, who was director of ARPA at 
   the time, has been at some pains to debunk the 
   <italic>survive-a-nuclear-war</italic> myth, but it seems unkillable.As originally imagined, ARPANET's major use would have been to
   support what is now called remote login and more sophisticated forms of
   distributed computing, but the infant technology of electronic mail quickly
   grew to dominate actual usage.  Universities, research labs and defense
   contractors early discovered the Internet's potential as a medium of
   communication between <emphasis>humans</emphasis> and linked up in steadily
   increasing numbers, connecting together a quirky mix of academics, techies,
   hippies, SF fans, hackers, and anarchists.  The roots of this lexicon lie
   in those early years.Over the next quarter-century the Internet evolved in many ways. The
   typical machine/OS combination moved from <name>DEC</name>
   <name>PDP-10</name>s and <name>PDP-20</name>s, running
   <name>TOPS-10</name> and <name>TOPS-20</name>, to
   PDP-11s and <name>VAX</name>en and Suns running
   <name>Unix</name>, and in the 1990s to Unix on Intel
   microcomputers.  The Internet's protocols grew more capable, most notably
   in the move from NCP/IP to <name>TCP/IP</name> in 1982 and the
   implementation of Domain Name Service in 1983.  It was around this time
   that people began referring to the collection of interconnected networks
   with ARPANET at its core as <italic>the Internet</italic>.The ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation guidelines --
   connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related research
   project.  By the mid-80s, many of the organizations clamoring to join
   didn't fit this profile.  In 1986, the National Science Foundation built
   NSFnet to open up access to its five regional supercomputing centers;
   NSFnet became the backbone of the Internet, replacing the original ARPANET
   pipes (which were formally shut down in 1990).  Between 1990 and late 1994
   the pieces of NSFnet were sold to major telecommunications companies until
   the Internet backbone had gone completely commercial.That year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream culture discovered
   the Internet.  Once again, the <name>killer app</name> was not
   the anticipated one &#8212; rather, what caught the public imagination was
   the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web.  Subsequently
   the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger (the OSI protocol
   stack favored by European telecoms monopolies) and is in the process of
   absorbing into itself many of the proprietary networks built during the
   second wave of wide-area networking after 1980.  By 1996 it had become a
   commonplace even in mainstream media to predict that a globally-extended
   Internet would become the key unifying communications technology of the
   next century. See also <name>the network</name>.</def>

    <def> [South Africa] A cup of tea with milk and one teaspoon of sugar,
   where the milk is poured into the cup before the tea.  Variations are ISO
   0, with no sugar; ISO 2, with two spoons of sugar; and so on.This may derive from the <italic>NATO standard</italic> cup of coffee
   and tea (milk and two sugars), military slang going back to the late 1950s
   and parodying NATO's relentless bureaucratic drive to standardize parts
   across European and U.S. militaries.Like many ISO standards, this one has a faintly alien ring in North
   America, where hackers generally shun the decadent British practice of
   adulterating perfectly good tea with dairy products and prefer instead to
   add a wedge of lemon, if anything.  If one were feeling extremely silly,
   one might hypothesize an analogous <emphasis>ANSI standard
   cup of tea</emphasis> and wind up with a political situation distressingly
   similar to several that arise in much more serious technical contexts.
   (Milk and lemon don't mix very well.)[2000 update: There is now, in fact, an ISO standard 3103:
   &#8216;Method for preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory
   tests.&#8217;, alleged to be equivalent to British Standard BS6008:
   How to make a standard cup of tea.

    <def> 1. Incompatible Time-sharing System, an influential though highly
   idiosyncratic operating system written for PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT and
   long used at the MIT AI Lab.  Much AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS
   folklore, and to have been &#8216;an ITS hacker&#8217; qualifies one
   instantly as an old-timer of the most venerable sort.  ITS pioneered many
   important innovations, including transparent file sharing between machines
   and terminal-independent I/O.  After about 1982, most actual work was
   shifted to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run essentially as
   a hobby and service to the hacker community.  The shutdown of the lab's
   last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end of an era and sent old-time
   hackers into mourning nationwide (see 
   <name>high moby</name>).  There is an ITS home page. 2. A mythical image of operating-system perfection worshiped by a
   bizarre, fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and ex-users (see
   <name>troglodyte</name>, sense 2).  ITS worshipers manage somehow
   to continue believing that an OS maintained by assembly-language
   hand-hacking that supported only monocase 6-character filenames in one

   (their venom against <name>Unix</name> is particularly intense).

   originally sold to Sun as an embedded language for use in set-top boxes).
   After the great Internet explosion of 1993-1994, Java was hacked into a
   byte-interpreted language and became the focus of a relentless hype
   campaign by Sun, which touted it as the new language of choice for
   distributed applications.Java is indeed a stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been
   embraced by many in the hacker community &#8212; but it has been a
   considerable source of frustration to many others, for reasons ranging from
   uneven support on different Web browser platforms, performance issues, and
   some notorious deficiencies in some of the standard toolkits (AWT in
   particular).  <name>Microsoft</name>'s determined attempts to
   corrupt the language (which it rightly sees as a threat to its OS monopoly)
   have not helped.  As of 2003, these issues are still in the process of
   being resolved.Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult
   to find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a
   complex, real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days yet,
   and no other language has ever been forced to spend its childhood under the
   limelight the way Java has).  On the other hand, Java has already been a

   simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the file names.

   reported that hackers at IBM itself sometimes sing <italic>Who's the breeder

   consistent that &#8216;kluge&#8217; was the original spelling, reported
   around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used
   exclusively of <emphasis>hardware</emphasis> kluges.  In 1947, the
   New York Folklore Quarterly reported a classic
   shaggy-dog story &#8216;Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker&#8217; then current in
   the Armed Forces, in which a &#8216;kluge&#8217; was a complex and puzzling
   artifact with a trivial function.  Other sources report that
   &#8216;kluge&#8217; was common Navy slang in the WWII era for any piece of
   electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at
   sea.However, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade
   older.  Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of a device
   called a <italic>Kluge paper feeder</italic>, an adjunct to mechanical
   printing presses.  Legend has it that the Kluge feeder was designed before
   small, cheap electric motors and control electronics; it relied on a
   fiendishly complex assortment of cams, belts, and linkages to both power
   and synchronize all its operations from one motive driveshaft.  It was
   accordingly temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly
   difficult to repair &#8212; but oh, so clever!  People who tell this story
   also aver that &#8216;Kluge&#8217; was the name of a design
   engineer.There is in fact a Brandtjen &amp; Kluge Inc., an old family business
   that manufactures printing equipment &#8212; interestingly, their name is
   pronounced <emphasis>/kloo´gee/</emphasis>!
   Henry Brandtjen, president of the firm, told me (ESR, 1994) that his
   company was co-founded by his father and an engineer named Kluge <emphasis>/kloo´gee/</emphasis>, who built and co-designed
   the original Kluge automatic feeder in 1919.  Mr. Brandtjen claims,
   however, that this was a <emphasis>simple</emphasis> device (with only four
   cams); he says he has no idea how the myth of its complexity took hold.
   Other correspondents differ with Mr. Brandtjen's history of the device and
   his allegation that it was a simple rather than complex one, but agree that
   the Kluge automatic feeder was the most likely source of the
   folklore.<name>TMRC</name> and the MIT hacker culture of the early
   '60s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used
   some WWII military slang (see also <name>foobar</name>).  It
   seems likely that &#8216;kluge&#8217; came to MIT via alumni of the many
   military electronics projects that had been located in Cambridge (many in
   MIT's venerable Building 20, in which <name>TMRC</name> is also
   located) during the war.The variant &#8216;kludge&#8217; was apparently popularized by the
   <name>Datamation</name> article mentioned under
   <name>kludge</name>; it was titled How to Design a
   Kludge (February 1962, pp. 30, 31).  This spelling was probably
   imported from Great Britain, where <name>kludge</name> has an
   independent history (though this fact was largely unknown to hackers on
   either side of the Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate in the Usenet group
   alt.folklore.computers over the
   First and Second Edition versions of this entry; everybody used to think
   <name>kludge</name> was just a mutation of
   <name>kluge</name>).  It now appears that the British, having
   forgotten the etymology of their own &#8216;kludge&#8217; when
   &#8216;kluge&#8217; crossed the Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing the
   &#8216;kludge&#8217; orthography in the other direction and confusing their
   American cousins' spelling!The result of this history is a tangle.  Many younger U.S. hackers
   pronounce the word as <emphasis>/klooj/</emphasis> but
   spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as
   &#8216;kludge&#8217;. (Phonetically, consider huge, refuge, centrifuge, and
   deluge as opposed to sludge, judge, budge, and fudge.  Whatever its
   failings in other areas, English spelling is perfectly consistent about
   this distinction.)  British hackers mostly learned <emphasis>/kluhj/</emphasis> orally, use it in a restricted
   negative sense and are at least consistent.  European hackers have mostly
   learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it
   <emphasis>/kluhj/</emphasis> but use the wider
   American meaning!Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's
   meaning.</def>

    <term>Kool-Aid</term>
    <def> [from a kid's sugar-enriched drink in fruity flavors] When someone
   who should know better succumbs to marketing influences and actually begins
   to believe the propaganda being dished out by a vendor, they are said to
   have drunk the Kool-Aid.  Usually the decortication process is slow and
   almost unnoticeable until one day the victim emerges as a True Believer and
   begins spreading the faith himself.  The term originates in the suicide of
   914 followers of Jim Jones's People's Temple cult in Guyana in 1978 (there
   are also resonances with Ken Kesey's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Tests from the
   1960s).  What the Jonestown victims actually drank was cyanide-laced
   Flavor-Aid, a cheap knockoff, rather than Kool-Aid itself.  There is a
   
   FAQ on this topic.This has live variants.  When a suit is blithering on about their
   latest technology and how it will save the world, that's &#8216;pouring
   Kool-Aid&#8217;. When the suit does not violate the laws of physics,

    <def> [from the then-large number of <name>Usenet</name>
   <name>VAXen</name> with names of the form foovax] Originally, a fictitious Usenet site
   at the Kremlin, announced on April 1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly
   originated there by Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko.  The  posting
   was actually forged by Piet Beertema as an April Fool's joke.  Other
   fictitious sites mentioned in the hoax were moskvax and <name>kgbvax</name>.
   This was probably the funniest of the many April Fool's forgeries
   perpetrated on Usenet (which has negligible security against them), because
   the notion that Usenet might ever penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so
   totally absurd at the time.In fact, it was only six years later that the first genuine site in
   Moscow, demos.su, joined Usenet.
   Some readers needed convincing that the postings from it weren't just
   another prank.  Vadim Antonov, senior programmer at Demos and the major
   poster from there up to mid-1991, was quite aware of all this, referred to
   it frequently in his own postings, and at one point twitted some credulous
   readers by blandly asserting that he <emphasis>was</emphasis> a
   hoax!Eventually he even arranged to have the domain's gateway site named
   kremvax, thus neatly turning
   fiction into fact and demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor
   transcends cultural barriers.  [Mr. Antonov also contributed the
   Russian-language material for this lexicon. &#8212;ESR]In an even more ironic historical footnote, kremvax became an electronic center of the
   anti-communist resistance during the bungled hard-line coup of August 1991.
   During those three days the Soviet UUCP network centered on kremvax became the only trustworthy news
   source for many places within the USSR.  Though the sysops were
   concentrating on internal communications, cross-border postings included
   immediate transliterations of Boris Yeltsin's decrees condemning the coup
   and eyewitness reports of the demonstrations in Moscow's streets.  In those
   hours, years of speculation that totalitarianism would prove unable to
   maintain its grip on politically-loaded information in the age of computer
   networking were proved devastatingly accurate &#8212; and the original
   kremvax joke became a reality as
   Yeltsin and the new Russian revolutionaries of <emphasis>glasnost</emphasis> and <emphasis>perestroika</emphasis> made kremvax one of the timeliest means of their
   outreach to the West.</def>

   by posting lots of silly messages, uploading virus-ridden software,
   frequently dropping carrier, etc.Crackers also use it to refer to cracker
   <name>wannabee</name>s. In phreak culture, a lamer is one who
   scams codes off others rather than doing cracks or really understanding the
   fundamental concepts.  In <name>warez d00dz</name> culture, where
   the ability to wave around cracked commercial software within days of (or
   before) release to the commercial market is much esteemed, the lamer might
   try to upload garbage or shareware or something incredibly old (old in this
   context is read as a few years to anything older than 3 days).
   &#8216;Lamer&#8217; is also much used in the IRC world in a similar sense
   to the above.This term seems to have originated in the Commodore-64 scene in the
   mid 1980s.  It was popularized among Amiga crackers of the mid-1980s by
   &#8216;Lamer Exterminator&#8217;, the most famous and feared Amiga virus

    <def> 1. [Usenet] A bug in some now-obsolete versions of the netnews
   software that used to eat up to BUFSIZ bytes of the article text.  The bug
   was triggered by having the text of the article start with a space or tab.
   This bug was quickly personified as a mythical creature called the
   <emphasis>line eater</emphasis>, and postings often
   included a dummy line of <emphasis>line eater
   food</emphasis>.  Ironically, line eater &#8216;food&#8217; not beginning
   with a space or tab wasn't actually eaten, since the bug was avoided; but
   if there <emphasis>was</emphasis> a space or tab before it, then the line
   eater would eat the food <emphasis>and</emphasis> the beginning of the text
   it was supposed to be protecting.  The practice of <emphasis>sacrificing to the line eater</emphasis> continued for

   coined around 1975 at MIT.  Under ITS, when you first walked up to a
   terminal at MIT and typed Control-Z to get the computer's attention, it
   printed out some status information, including how many people were already
   using the computer; it might print <italic>14 users</italic>, for example.
   Someone thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to print
   <italic>14 losers</italic> instead.  There ensued a great controversy, as
   some of the users didn't particularly want to be called losers to their
   faces every time they used the computer.  For a while several hackers
   struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the back of the
   others; any time you logged into the computer it was even money whether it
   would say <italic>users</italic> or <italic>losers</italic>.  Finally, someone
   tried the compromise <italic>lusers</italic>, and it stuck.  Later one of the
   ITS machines supported luser as a
   request-for-help command.  ITS died the death in mid-1990, except as a

   with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several special-purpose languages
   built around a macro-expansion facility (such as TeX or Unix's [nt]roff
   suite).Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective <emphasis>macros</emphasis> is now sometimes used for code in any
   special-purpose application control language (whether or not the language
   is actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities such

    <def> [Unix; common]  1. Something passed between routines or programs that enables the
   receiver to perform some operation; a capability ticket or opaque
   identifier.  Especially used of small data objects that contain data
   encoded in a strange or intrinsically machine-dependent way.  E.g., on
   non-Unix OSes with a non-byte-stream model of files, the result of
   ftell3
   may be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset; it can be passed to
   fseek3,
   but not operated on in any meaningful way.  The phrase <emphasis>it hands you a magic cookie</emphasis> means it returns a

   significant to the operation of a program and that is inserted
   inconspicuously in-line (<name>hardcoded</name>), rather than
   expanded in by a symbol set by a commented #define.  Magic numbers in this sense are bad style.
    2. A number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm
   in some opaque way.  The classic examples of these are the numbers used in
   hash or CRC functions, or the coefficients in a linear congruential
   generator for pseudo-random numbers.  This sense actually predates and was
   ancestral to the more common sense 3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file to
   indicate its type to a utility.  Under Unix, the system and various
   applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish between types of
   executable file by looking for a magic number.  Once upon a time, these
   magic numbers were <name>PDP-11</name> branch instructions that
   skipped over header data to the start of executable code; 0407, for
   example, was octal for &#8216;branch 16 bytes relative&#8217;.  Many other
   kinds of files now have magic numbers somewhere; some magic numbers are, in
   fact, strings, like the !&lt;arch&gt; at the beginning
   of a Unix archive file or the %! leading PostScript
   files.  Nowadays only a <name>wizard</name> knows the spells to
   create magic numbers.  How do you choose a fresh magic number of your own?
   Simple &#8212; you pick one at random.  See?  It's magic!   4. An input that leads to a computational boundary condition, where
   algorithm behavior becomes discontinuous.  Numeric overflows (particularly
   with signed data types) and run-time errors (divide by zero, stack
   overflows) are indications of magic numbers.  The Y2K scare was probably
   the most notorious magic number non-incident.<emphasis>The</emphasis> magic number, on the other hand, is
   7±2.  See The magical
   number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing
   information by George Miller, in the Psychological
   Review 63:81-97 (1956).  This classic paper established the

   plugged one in backwards.  I only discovered that
   after I realized that Intel didn't put power-on lights
   under the quartz windows on the tops of their EPROMs &#8212; the die was
   glowing white-hot.  Amazingly, the EPROM worked fine after I erased it,
   filled it full of zeros, then erased it again.  For all I know, it's still
   in service.  Of course, this is because the magic smoke didn't get let
   out.</italic> Compare the original phrasing of

    <def> (often shortened in context to <emphasis>list</emphasis>) 1. An <name>email</name> address that is an alias (or
   <name>macro</name>, though that word is never used in this
   connection) for many other email addresses.  Some mailing lists are simple
   <emphasis>reflectors</emphasis>, redirecting mail sent to
   them to the list of recipients.  Others are filtered by humans or programs
   of varying degrees of sophistication; lists filtered by humans are said to
   be <emphasis>moderated</emphasis>.   2. The people who receive your email when you send it to such an
   address.Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction,
   along with <name>Usenet</name>.  They predate Usenet, having
   originated with the first UUCP and ARPANET connections.  They are often
   used for private information-sharing on topics that would be too
   specialized for or inappropriate to public Usenet groups.  Though some of
   these maintain almost purely technical content (such as the Internet
   Engineering Task Force mailing list), others (like the
   &#8216;sf-lovers&#8217; list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe) are
   recreational, and many are purely social.  Perhaps the most infamous of the
   social lists was the eccentric bandykin distribution; its latter-day progeny,
   lectroids and tanstaafl, still include a number of the
   oddest and most interesting people in hackerdom.Mailing lists are easy to create and (unlike Usenet) don't tie up a
   significant amount of machine resources (until they get very large, at
   which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail software).
   Thus, they are often created temporarily by working groups, the members of
   which can then collaborate on a project without ever needing to meet
   face-to-face.  Much of the material in this lexicon was criticized and
   polished on just such a mailing list (called &#8216;jargon-friends&#8217;),
   which included all the co-authors of Steele-1983.</def>

    <def> Term originally referring to the cabinet containing the central

   <name>Stone Age</name> batch machine.  After the emergence of
   smaller <emphasis>minicomputer</emphasis> designs in the

   described as &#8216;mainframe computers&#8217; and eventually just as
   mainframes.  The term carries the connotation of a machine designed for
   batch rather than interactive use, though possibly with an interactive
   timesharing operating system retrofitted onto it; it is especially used of
   machines built by IBM, Unisys, and the other great
   <name>dinosaur</name>s surviving from computing's
   <name>Stone Age</name>.It has been common wisdom among hackers since the late 1980s that the
   mainframe architectural tradition is essentially dead (outside of the tiny
   market for <name>number-crunching</name> supercomputers having
   been swamped by the recent huge advances in IC technology and low-cost
   personal computing.  The wave of failures, takeovers, and mergers among
   traditional mainframe makers in the early 1990s bore this out.  The biggest
   mainframer of all, IBM, was compelled to re-invent itself as a huge
   systems-consulting house.  (See <name>dinosaurs mating</name> and
   <name>killer micro</name>).However, in yet another instance of the 
   <name>cycle of reincarnation</name>, the port of Linux to the IBM S/390 architecture
   in 1999 &#8212; assisted by IBM &#8212; produced a resurgence of interest in mainframe
   computing as a way of providing huge quantities of easily maintainable,
   reliable virtual Linux servers, saving IBM's mainframe division from almost

   By extension, the term <italic>man page</italic> may be used to refer to
   documentation of any kind, under any system, though it is most likely to be
   confined to short on-line references.As mentioned in , there is a
   standard syntax for referring to man page entries: the phrase
   <italic>foo(n)</italic> refers to the page for <italic>foo</italic> in chapter
   n of the manual, where chapter 1 is user commands, chapter 2 is system
   calls, etc.The man page format is beloved, or berated, for having the same sort
   of pithy utility as the rest of Unix.  Man pages tend to be written as very
   compact, concise descriptions which are complete but not forgiving of the
   lazy or careless reader.  Their stylized format does a good job of
   summarizing the essentials: invocation syntax, options, basic
   functionality.  While such a concise reference is perfect for the
   do-one-thing-and-do-it-well tools which are favored by the Unix philosophy,
   it admittedly breaks down when applied to a command which is itself a major

    <def> A legendary tragic failure, the archetypal Hacker Dream Gone Wrong.
   Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10-compatible computers built by
   Systems Concepts (now, The SC Group): the multi-processor SC-30M, the small
   uniprocessor SC-25, and the never-built superprocessor SC-40.  These
   machines were marvels of engineering design; although not much slower than
   the unique <name>Foonly</name> F-1, they were physically smaller
   and consumed less power than the much slower <name>DEC</name>
   KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4 machines.  They were also completely
   compatible with the DEC KL10, and ran all KL10 binaries (including the
   operating system) with no modifications at about 2--3 times faster than a
   KL10.When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983 (their followup to the
   PDP-10), Systems Concepts should have made a bundle selling their machine
   into shops with a lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their
   spring 1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the PDP-10
   world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of 1984, and TOPS-20
   by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers running Systems Concepts were
   much better at designing machines than at mass producing or selling them;
   the company allowed itself to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism
   into continually improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery
   dates continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;
   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and
   <name>VAX</name> 8600 and failed to reckon with the likes of Sun
   Microsystems and other hungry startups building workstations with power
   comparable to the KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped
   the first SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made
   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or Unix
   boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being purchased by
   CompuServe.This tale and the related saga of <name>Foonly</name> hold

   never (well, hardly ever) use &#8216;foo&#8217; or other words like it as
   permanent names for anything.  In filenames, a common convention is that
   any filename beginning with a metasyntactic-variable name is a
   <name>scratch</name> file that may be deleted at any time.Metasyntactic variables are so called because (1) they are variables
   in the metalanguage used to talk about programs etc; (2) they are variables
   whose values are often variables (as in usages like <italic>the value of
   f(foo,bar) is the sum of foo and bar</italic>).  However, it has been
   plausibly suggested that the real reason for the term <italic>metasyntactic
   variable</italic> is that it sounds good.  To some extent, the list of one's
   preferred metasyntactic variables is a cultural signature.  They occur both
   in series (used for related groups of variables or objects) and as
   singletons.  Here are a few common signatures: Of all these,
   only <emphasis>foo</emphasis> and <emphasis>bar</emphasis> are universal (and
   <name>baz</name> nearly so).  The compounds
   <name>foobar</name> and <emphasis>foobaz</emphasis> also enjoy very wide currency.  Some

   Thus, the standard put-down question at an MFTL talk is <italic>Has it been

    <def> 1. Very small; this is the root of its use as a quantifier prefix.
 2. A quantifier prefix, calling for multiplication by
   10-6 (see
   <name>quantifiers</name>).  Neither of these uses is peculiar to
   hackers, but hackers tend to fling them both around rather more freely than
   is countenanced in standard English.  It is recorded, for example, that one
   CS professor used to characterize the standard length of his lectures as a
   microcentury &#8212; that is, about 52.6 minutes (see also
   <name>attoparsec</name>, <name>nanoacre</name>, and

   is generalized from <emphasis>microcomputer</emphasis>,
   and is esp. used in contrast with <emphasis>macro-</emphasis> (the corresponding Greek prefix meaning
   &#8216;large&#8217;).   4. Local as opposed to global (or <name>macro-</name>).
   Thus a hacker might say that buying a smaller car to reduce pollution only
   solves a microproblem; the macroproblem of getting to work might be better
   solved by using mass transit, moving to within walking distance, or (best

    <def> [abbreviation]  1. A measure of computing speed; formally, &#8216;Million
   Instructions Per Second&#8217; (that's
   106 per second, not
   220!); often rendered by
   hackers as &#8216;Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed&#8217; or in
   other unflattering ways, such as &#8216;Meaningless Information Provided by
   Salesmen&#8217;.  This joke expresses an attitude nearly universal among

   [common] A feature that eventually causes lossage, possibly because it is
   not adequate for a new situation that has evolved.  Since it results from a
   deliberate and properly implemented feature, a misfeature is not a bug.
   Nor is it a simple unforeseen side effect; the term implies that the
   feature in question was carefully planned, but its long-term consequences
   were not accurately or adequately predicted (which is quite different from
   not having thought ahead at all).  A misfeature can be a particularly
   stubborn problem to resolve, because fixing it usually involves a
   substantial philosophical change to the structure of the system
   involved.Many misfeatures (especially in user-interface design) arise because
   the designers/implementors mistake their personal tastes for laws of
   nature.  Often a former feature becomes a misfeature because trade-offs
   were made whose parameters subsequently change (possibly only in the
   judgment of the implementors).  <italic>Well, yeah, it is kind of a
   misfeature that file names are limited to six characters, but the original
   implementors wanted to save directory space and we're stuck with it for
   now.</italic></def>

    <def> [MIT: seems to have been in use among model railroad fans years ago.
   Derived from Melville's Moby Dick (some say from

   impressive.  <italic>A Saturn V rocket is a truly moby frob.</italic>
   <italic>Some MIT undergrads pulled off a moby hack at the Harvard-Yale

   space of a machine (see below).  For a 680[234]0 or
   <name>VAX</name> or most modern 32-bit architectures, it is
   4,294,967,296 8-bit bytes (4 gigabytes).   3. A title of address (never of third-person reference), usually
   used to show admiration, respect, and/or friendliness to a competent
   hacker.  <italic>Greetings, moby Dave.  How's that address-book thing for
   the Mac going?</italic> 4. <emphasis>adj.</emphasis> In backgammon, doubles
   on the dice, as in <emphasis>moby sixes</emphasis>,
   <emphasis>moby ones</emphasis>, etc.  Compare this with
   <name>bignum</name> (sense 3): double sixes are both bignums and
   moby sixes, but moby ones are not bignums (the use of <emphasis>moby</emphasis> to describe double ones is sarcastic).
   Standard emphatic forms: <emphasis>Moby foo</emphasis>,
   <emphasis>moby win</emphasis>, <emphasis>moby loss</emphasis>.  <emphasis>Foby
   moo</emphasis>: a spoonerism due to Richard Greenblatt.   5. The largest available unit of something which is available in
   discrete increments.  Thus, ordering a <italic>moby Coke</italic> at the
   local fast-food joint is not just a request for a large Coke, it's an
   explicit request for the largest size they sell.This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge when it
   was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical memory size for a
   timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a moby is classically 256K
   36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or PDP-10 moby.  Back when address
   registers were narrow the term was more generally useful, because when a
   computer had virtual memory mapping, it might actually have more physical
   memory attached to it than any one program could access directly.  One
   could then say <italic>This computer has 6 mobies</italic> meaning that the
   ratio of physical memory to address space is 6, without having to say
   specifically how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that
   the computer could timeshare six &#8216;full-sized&#8217; programs without
   having to swap programs between memory and disk.Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto a
   machine, so most systems have much <emphasis>less</emphasis> than one
   theoretical &#8216;native&#8217; moby of <name>core</name>.
   Also, more modern memory-management techniques (esp. paging) make the
   &#8216;moby count&#8217; less significant.  However, there is one series of
   widely-used chips for which the term could stand to be revived &#8212; the
   Intel 8088 and 80286 with their incredibly
   <name>brain-damaged</name> segmented-memory designs.  On these, a
   <emphasis>moby</emphasis> would be the 1-megabyte address
   span of a segment/offset pair (by coincidence, a PDP-10 moby was exactly 1
   megabyte of 9-bit bytes).</def>

    <def> [common] A general state, usually used with an adjective describing
   the state.  Use of the word &#8216;mode&#8217; rather than
   &#8216;state&#8217; implies that the state is extended over time, and
   probably also that some activity characteristic of that state is being
   carried out. <italic>No time to hack; I'm in thesis mode.</italic> In its
   jargon sense, &#8216;mode&#8217; is most often attributed to people, though
   it is sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects. In particular,
   see <name>hack mode</name>, <name>day mode</name>,
   <name>night mode</name>, <name>demo mode</name>,
   <name>fireworks mode</name>, and 
   <name>yoyo mode</name>; also <name>talk mode</name>.One also often hears the verbs <emphasis>enable</emphasis> and <emphasis>disable</emphasis> used in connection with jargon modes.
   Thus, for example, a sillier way of saying <italic>I'm going to
   crash</italic> is <italic>I'm going to enable crash mode now</italic>.  One
   might also hear a request to <italic>disable flame mode,
   please</italic>.In a usage much closer to techspeak, a mode is a special state that
   certain user interfaces must pass into in order to perform certain
   functions.  For example, in order to insert characters into a document in
   the Unix editor vi, one must type the
   <italic>i</italic> key, which invokes the <italic>Insert</italic> command.  The
   effect of this command is to put vi into <italic>insert mode</italic>, in
   which typing the <italic>i</italic> key has a quite different effect (to wit,
   it inserts an <italic>i</italic> into the document).  One must then hit
   another special key, <italic>ESC</italic>, in order to leave <italic>insert
   mode</italic>.  Nowadays, modeful interfaces are generally considered
   <name>losing</name> but survive in quite a few widely used tools

    <def>Any one of several similar folk theorems that fit computing capacity
   or cost to a 2t exponential curve, with doubling
   time close to a year.  The most common fits component density to such a
   curve (previous versions of this entry gave that form).  Another variant
   asserts that the dollar cost of constant computing power decreases on the
   same curve.  The original Moore's Law, first uttered in 1965 by
   semiconductor engineer Gordon Moore (who co-founded Intel four years
   later), spoke of the number of components on the lowest-cost silicon
   integrated circuits &#8212; but Moore's own formulation varied somewhat
   over the years, and reconstructing the meaning of the terminology he used
   in the original turns out to be fraught with difficulties.  Further
   variants were spawned by Intel's PR department and various
   journalists.It has been shown
   that none of the variants of Moore's Law actually fit the data very well
   (the price curves within DRAM generations perhaps come closest).
   Nevertheless, Moore's Law is constantly invoked to set up expectations
   about the next generation of computing technology.  See also

    <def> [MicroSoft Disk Operating System] A <name>clone</name> of

   hacker Tim Paterson at Seattle Computer Products, who called the original
   QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) and is said to have regretted it
   ever since.  Microsoft licensed QDOS in order to have something to demo for
   IBM on time, and the rest is history.  Numerous features, including vaguely
   Unix-like but rather broken support for subdirectories, I/O redirection,
   and pipelines, were hacked into Microsoft's 2.0 and subsequent versions; as
   a result, there are two or more incompatible versions of many system calls,
   and MS-DOS programmers can never agree on basic things like what character
   to use as an option switch or whether to be case-sensitive.  The resulting
   appalling mess is now the highest-unit-volume OS in history.  Often known
   simply as DOS, which annoys people familiar with other similarly
   abbreviated operating systems (the name goes back to the mid-1960s, when it
   was attached to IBM's first disk operating system for the 360).  The name
   further annoys those who know what the term 
   <name>operating system</name> does (or ought to) connote; DOS is more properly a set
   of relatively simple interrupt services.  Some people like to pronounce DOS
   like <italic>dose</italic>, as in <italic>I don't work on dose, man!</italic>,
   or to compare it to a dose of brain-damaging drugs (a slogan button in wide
   circulation among hackers exhorts: <italic>MS-DOS: Just say No!</italic>).

    <def> [acronym, Multi-User Dungeon; alt.: Multi-User Dimension]  1.  A class of <name>virtual reality</name> experiments
   accessible via the Internet.  These are real-time chat forums with
   structure; they have multiple &#8216;locations&#8217; like an adventure
   game, and may include combat, traps, puzzles, magic, a simple economic
   system, and the capability for characters to build more structure onto the
   database that represents the existing world.   2. <emphasis>vi.</emphasis> To play a MUD.  The
   acronym MUD is often lowercased and/or verbed; thus, one may speak of
   <emphasis>going mudding</emphasis>, etc.Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of MU-
   form) derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the
   University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of that game
   still exist today and are sometimes generically called
   <emphasis>BartleMUD</emphasis>s.  There is a widespread myth (repeated,
   unfortunately, by earlier versions of this lexicon) that the name MUD was
   trademarked to the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British Telecom (the
   motto: <italic>You haven't lived 'til you've
   died on MUD!</italic>); however, this is false &#8212;
   Richard Bartle explicitly placed &#8216;MUD&#8217; in the public domain in
   1985.  BT was upset at this, as they had already printed trademark claims
   on some maps and posters, which were released and created the myth.Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the
   MUD concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD).  Many of
   these had associated bulletin-board systems for social interaction.
   Because these had an image as &#8216;research&#8217; they often survived
   administrative hostility to BBSs in general.  This, together with the fact
   that Usenet feeds were often spotty and difficult to get in the U.K., made
   the MUDs major foci of hackish social interaction there.AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and
   quickly gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for large hacker
   communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom (some observers
   see parallels with the growth of Usenet in the early 1980s).  The second
   wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants) tended to emphasize social interaction,
   puzzles, and cooperative world-building as opposed to combat and
   competition (in writing, these social MUDs are sometimes referred to as
   &#8216;MU*&#8217;, with &#8216;MUD&#8217; implicitly reserved for the more
   game-oriented ones).  By 1991, over 50% of MUD sites were of a third major
   variety, LPMUD, which synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and
   older systems with the extensibility of TinyMud.  In 1996 the cutting edge
   of the technology is Pavel Curtis's MOO, even more extensible using a
   built-in object-oriented language.  The trend toward greater
   programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue.The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly, with
   new simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month.  Around 1991
   there was an unsuccessful movement to deprecate the term
   <name>MUD</name> itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding
   variety of names corresponding to the different simulation styles being
   explored.  It survived.  See also <name>bonk/oif</name>,

   An early timesharing <name>operating system</name> co-designed
   by a consortium including MIT, GE, and Bell Laboratories as a successor to
   <name>CTSS</name>.  The design was first presented in 1965,
   planned for operation in 1967, first operational in 1969, and took several
   more years to achieve respectable performance and stability.Multics was very innovative for its time &#8212; among other things,
   it provided a hierarchical file system with access control on individual
   files and introduced the idea of treating all devices uniformly as special
   files.  It was also the first OS to run on a symmetric multiprocessor, and
   the only general-purpose system to be awarded a B2 security rating by the
   NSA (see <name>Orange Book</name>).Bell Labs left the development effort in 1969 after judging that
   <name>second-system effect</name> had bloated Multics to the
   point of practical unusability.  Honeywell commercialized Multics in 1972
   after buying out GE's computer group, but it was never very successful: at
   its peak in the 1980s, there were between 75 and 100 Multics sites, each a
   multi-million dollar mainframe.One of the former Multics developers from Bell Labs was Ken Thompson,
   and <name>Unix</name> deliberately carried through and extended
   many of Multics' design ideas; indeed, Thompson described the very name
   &#8216;Unix&#8217; as <italic>a weak pun on Multics</italic>.  For this and
   other reasons, aspects of the Multics design remain a topic of occasional
   debate among hackers.  See also <name>brain-damaged</name> and
   <name>GCOS</name>.MIT ended its development association with Multics in 1977.
   Honeywell sold its computer business to Bull in the mid 80s, and
   development on Multics was stopped in 1988.  Four Multics sites were known
   to be still in use as late as 1998, but the last one (a Canadian military
   site) was decommissioned in November 2000.  There is a Multics page at

    <def> The correct, <emphasis>original</emphasis> Murphy's Law reads:
   <italic>If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways
   can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it.</italic> This is a
   principle of defensive design, cited here because it is usually given in
   mutant forms less descriptive of the challenges of design for
   <name>luser</name>s.  For example, you don't make a two-pin plug
   symmetrical and then label it <italic>THIS WAY UP</italic>; if it matters
   which way it is plugged in, then you make the design asymmetrical (see also
   the anecdote under <name>magic smoke</name>).Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of McDonnell-Douglas's test
   engineers on the rocket-sled experiments that were done by the U.S. Air
   Force in 1949 to test human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981).
   One experiment involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different
   parts of the subject's body.  There were two ways each sensor could be
   glued to its mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 in a
   replacement set the wrong way around.  Murphy then made the original form
   of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp)
   mis-quoted (apparently in the more general form <italic>Whatever can go
   wrong, will go wrong)</italic> at a news conference a
   few days later.Within months &#8216;Murphy's Law&#8217; had spread to various
   technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering.  Before too many
   years had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination,
   changing as they went.  Most of these are variants on <italic>Anything that
   can go wrong, will</italic>; this is more correctly referred to as
   <name>Finagle's Law</name>.  The memetic drift apparent in these
   mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!</def>

    <def> A common extracurricular interest of hackers (compare
   <name>science-fiction fandom</name>, 
   <name>oriental food</name>; see also <name>filk</name>).  Hackish folklore
   has long claimed that musical and programming abilities are closely
   related, and there has been at least one large-scale statistical study that
   supports this.  Hackers, as a rule, like music and often develop musical
   appreciation in unusual and interesting directions.  Folk music is very big
   in hacker circles; so is electronic music, and the sort of elaborate
   instrumental jazz/rock that used to be called &#8216;progressive&#8217; and
   isn't recorded much any more.  The hacker's musical range tends to be wide;
   many can listen with equal appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle
   Giant, Pat Metheny, Scott Joplin, Tangerine Dream, Dream Theater, King
   Sunny Ade, The Pretenders, Screaming Trees, or the Brandenburg Concerti.
   It is also apparently true that hackerdom includes a much higher
   concentration of talented amateur musicians than one would expect from a
   similar-sized control group of <name>mundane</name> types.</def>

   Creation (Anchor/Doubleday, ISBN 0-385-19973-2), where he

   of this is triggered by the popular and very bloody shoot-'em-up game
   Doom on the PC.  When used in multiplayer
   mode over a network, the game uses broadcast packets to inform other
   machines when bullets are fired.  This causes problems with weapons like
   the chain gun which fire rapidly &#8212; it can blast the network into a

    <def> Pejorative hackerism for Sun's Network File System (NFS).  In any
   nontrivial network of Suns where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, when
   one Sun goes down, the others often freeze up.  Some machine tries to
   access the down one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely.  This
   causes it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually happening is
   that it is locked up in what should have been a brief excursion to a higher
   <name>spl</name> level).  Then another machine tries to reach
   either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself becomes
   pseudo-down.  The first machine to discover the down one is now trying both
   to access the down one and to respond to the pseudo-down one, so it is even
   harder to reach.  This situation snowballs very quickly, and soon the
   entire network of machines is frozen &#8212; worst of all, the user can't
   even abort the file access that started the problem!  Many of NFS's
   problems are excused by partisans as being an inevitable result of its
   statelessness, which is held to be a great feature (critics, of course,
   call it a great <name>misfeature</name>).  (ITS partisans are apt
   to cite this as proof of Unix's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working
   NFS-like shared file system with none of these problems in the early
   1970s.)  See also <name>broadcast storm</name>.</def>

    <def> The National Security Agency trawling program sometimes assumed to
   be reading the net for the U.S. Government's spooks.  Most hackers used to
   think it was mythical but believed in acting as though existed just in
   case.  Since the mid-1990s it has gradually become known that the NSA
   actually does this, quite illegally, through its Echelon program.The standard countermeasure is to put loaded phrases like
   &#8216;KGB&#8217;, &#8216;Uzi&#8217;, &#8216;nuclear materials&#8217;,
   &#8216;Palestine&#8217;, &#8216;cocaine&#8217;, and

   (probably futile) attempt to confuse and overload the creature.  The
   <name>GNU</name> version of <name>EMACS</name> actually
   has a command that randomly inserts a bunch of insidious anarcho-verbiage
   into your edited text.As far back as the 1970s there was a mainstream variant of this myth
   involving a &#8216;Trunk Line Monitor&#8217;, which supposedly used speech
   recognition to extract words from telephone trunks.  This is much harder
   than noticing keywords in email, and most of the people who originally
   propagated it had no idea of then-current technology or the storage,
   signal-processing, or speech recognition needs of such a project.  On the
   basis of mass-storage costs alone it would have been cheaper to hire 50
   high-school students and just let them listen in.Twenty years and several orders of technological magnitude later,
   however, there are clear indications that the NSA has actually deployed
   such filtering (again, very much against U.S. law).  In 2000, the FBI wants
   to get into this act with its &#8216;Carnivore&#8217; surveillance
   system.</def>

   streetcar to the overhead line.  When the trolley stops making contact with
   the wire (from passing through a switch, going over bumpy track, or
   whatever), the streetcar comes to a halt, (usually) without crashing.  The
   streetcar is then said to be off the trolley, or off the wire.  Later on,
   trolley came to mean the streetcar itself.  Since streetcars became common
   in the 1890s, the term is more than 100 years old.  Nowadays, trolleys are

    <def> [from Greek suffix -oid = <emphasis>in the image
   of</emphasis>]  1. Used as in mainstream slang English to indicate a poor imitation,
   a counterfeit, or some otherwise slightly bogus resemblance.  Hackers will
   happily use it with all sorts of non-Greco/Latin stem words that wouldn't
   keep company with it in mainstream English.  For example, <italic>He's a
   nerdoid</italic> means that he superficially resembles a nerd but can't make
   the grade; a <emphasis>modemoid</emphasis> might be a
   300-baud box (Real Modems run at 28.8 or up); a <emphasis>computeroid</emphasis> might be any 
   <name>bitty box</name>.  The word <emphasis>keyboid</emphasis>
   could be used to describe a <name>chiclet keyboard</name>, but
   would have to be written; spoken, it would confuse the listener as to the
   speaker's city of origin.   2. More specifically, an indicator for &#8216;resembling an
   android&#8217; which in the past has been confined to science-fiction fans
   and hackers.  It too has recently (in 1991) started to go mainstream (most
   notably in the term &#8216;trendoid&#8217; for victims of terminal
   hipness).  This is probably traceable to the popularization of the term
   <name>droid</name> in Star Wars and its
   sequels.  (See also <name>windoid</name>.)Coinages in both forms have been common in science fiction for at
   least fifty years, and hackers (who are often SF fans) have probably been
   making &#8216;-oid&#8217; jargon for almost that
   long [though GLS and I can personally confirm only that they were already
   common in the mid-1970s &#8212;ESR].</def>

    <def> [common; also adj. <emphasis>open-source</emphasis>] Term coined in March 1998
   following the Mozilla release to describe software distributed in source
   under licenses guaranteeing anybody rights to freely use, modify, and
   redistribute, the code.  The intent was to be able to sell the hackers'
   ways of doing software to industry and the mainstream by avoiding the
   negative connotations (to <name>suit</name>s) of the term
   <italic>free software</italic>.  For discussion of the
   follow-on tactics and their consequences, see the Open Source Initiative
   site.Five years after this term was invented, in 2003, it is worth noting
   the huge shift in assumptions it helped bring about, if only because the
   hacker culture's collective memory of what went before is in some ways
   blurring. Hackers have so completely refocused themselves around the idea
   and ideal of open source that we are beginning to forget that we used to do
   most of our work in closed-source environments.  Until the late 1990s open
   source was a sporadic exception that usually had to live on top of a
   closed-source operating system and alongside closed-source tools; entire
   open-source environments like <name>Linux</name> and the *BSD
   systems didn't even exist in a usable form until around 1993 and weren't
   taken very seriously by anyone but a pioneering few until about five years

    </abbrev>
    <def> An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus Wirth on the CDC
   6600 around 1967--68 as an instructional tool for elementary programming.
   This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting themselves
   in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a
   general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a
   general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family of
   languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also
   <name>bondage-and-discipline language</name>).  The hackish point
   of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating (and, in its
   deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian Kernighan (of
   <name>K&amp;R</name> fame) entitled
   Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language,
   which was turned down by the technical journals but circulated widely via
   photocopies.  It was eventually published in Comparing and
   Assessing Programming Languages, edited by Alan Feuer and
   Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984).  Part of his discussion is worth
   repeating here, because its criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself
   after many years of improvement and could also stand as an indictment of
   many other bondage-and-discipline languages.  (The entire essay is
   available at http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html.)
   At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:Pascal has since been entirely displaced (mainly by
   <name>C</name>) from the niches it had acquired in serious
   applications and systems programming, and from its role as a teaching
   language by Java.</def>

   program.  IBM operating systems often receive updates to the operating
   system in the form of absolute hexadecimal patches.  If you have modified
   your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source.  The patches
   might later be corrected by other patches on top of them (patches were said
   to <italic>grow scar tissue</italic>).  The result was often a convoluted
   <name>patch space</name> and headaches galore. 5. [Unix] the
   patch1
   program, written by Larry Wall, which automatically applies a patch (sense
   3) to a set of source code.There is a classic story of a <name>tiger team</name>
   penetrating a secure military computer that illustrates the danger inherent
   in binary patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't &#8212; or don't
   &#8212; inspect and examine before installing).  They couldn't find any
   <name>trap door</name>s or any way to penetrate security of IBM's
   OS, so they made a site visit to an IBM office (remember, these were
   official military types who were purportedly on official business), swiped
   some IBM stationery, and created a fake patch.  The patch was actually the
   trapdoor they needed.  The patch was distributed at about the right time
   for an IBM patch, had official stationery and all accompanying
   documentation, and was dutifully installed.  The installation manager very
   shortly thereafter learned something about proper procedures.</def>

    <def> [Programmed Data Processor model 10] The machine that made

   facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab, Stanford, and CMU.
   Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the bit-field
   instructions) are still considered unsurpassed.  The 10 was eventually
   eclipsed by the <name>VAX</name> machines (descendants of the
   <name>PDP-11</name>) when <name>DEC</name> recognized
   that the 10 and <name>VAX</name> product lines were competing
   with each other and decided to concentrate its software development effort
   on the more profitable <name>VAX</name>.  The machine was finally
   dropped from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter
   Project at DEC to build a viable new model.  (Some attempts by other
   companies to market clones came to nothing; see
   <name>Foonly</name> and <name>Mars</name>.)  This event

   hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to consist of <emphasis>peek</emphasis>ing around memory, more or less at random,
   to find the location where the system keeps interesting stuff.  Long (and
   variably accurate) lists of such addresses for various computers

   depend on the phase of the moon.  There was a little subroutine that had
   traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
   approximation to the moon's true phase.  GLS incorporated this routine into
   a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a timestamp line
   almost 80 characters long.  Very occasionally the first line of the message
   would be too long and would overflow onto the next line, and when the file
   was later read back in the program would <name>barf</name>.  The
   length of the first line depended on both the precise date and time and the
   length of the phase specification when the timestamp was printed, and so
   the bug literally depended on the phase of the moon!The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an
   example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the
   typesetter &#8216;corrected&#8217; it.  This has since been described as
   the phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.However, beware of assumptions.  A few years ago, engineers of CERN
   (European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in
   experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator.  As the formidable
   amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed by computers
   before being seen by humans, many people suggested the software was somehow
   sensitive to the phase of the moon.  A few desperate engineers discovered
   the truth; the error turned out to be the result of a tiny change in the
   geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically caused by the
   deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon!  This story has
   entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle physics and
   as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest physical laws to
   the most modern science.</def>

   network (so as, for example, to make free long-distance calls).   2. By extension, security-cracking in any other context (especially,
   but not exclusively, on communications networks) (see
   <name>cracking</name>).At one time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among hackers;
   there was a gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an intellectual game
   and a form of exploration was OK, but serious theft of services was taboo.
   There was significant crossover between the hacker community and the
   hard-core phone phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their own
   through such media as the legendary TAP Newsletter.
   This ethos began to break down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of
   the techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks.  Around
   the same time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
   ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came to
   depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card numbers.
   The crimes and punishments of gangs like the &#8216;414 group&#8217; turned
   that game very ugly.  A few old-time hackers still phreak casually just to
   keep their hand in, but most these days have hardly even heard of
   &#8216;blue boxes&#8217; or any of the other paraphernalia of the great

described in January 1991 by Steve Hayman on the Usenet group
comp.sys.next.  He was trying to
isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to a NeXT
machine, and got tired of having to run back to his console after each cabling
tweak to see if the ping packets were getting through.  So he used the
sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote a script that repeatedly
invoked
ping8,
listened for an echo, and played back the recording on each returned packet.
Result?  A program that caused the machine to repeat, over and over,
<italic>Ping ... ping ... ping ...</italic> as long as the
network was up.  He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through the
building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector in no

   the Standard Kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
   near Paris.  (From 1889 to 1960, the meter was defined to be the distance
   between two scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that same vault
   &#8212; this replaced an earlier definition as
   10-7 times the distance
   between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian through Paris;
   unfortunately, this had been based on an inexact value of the circumference
   of the Earth.  From 1960 to 1984 it was defined to be 1650763.73
   wavelengths of the orange-red line of krypton-86 propagating in a vacuum.
   It is now defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum
   in the time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.  The kilogram is now the
   only unit of measure officially defined in terms of a unique artifact. But
   this will have to change; in 2003 it was revealed that the reference
   kilogram has been shedding mass over time, and is down by 50 micrograms.)

    <term>Postel's Prescription</term>
    <def>[proposed] Several of the key Internet <name>RFC</name>s,
   especially 1122 and 791 contain a piece of advice due to Jon Postel, 
   which is most often stated as:That is, a well-engineered implementation of any of the
   Internet protocols should be willing to deal with marginal
   and imperfectly-formed inputs, but should not assume that the
   program on the other end (that is, the program dealing with the
   well-engineered implementation's output) will be anything other
   than rigid and inflexible, and perhaps even incomplete or downright
   buggy.This property is valuable because a network of programs adhering
   to it will be much more robust in the presence of any uncertainties
   in the protocol specifications, or any individual implementor's
   failure to understand those specifications perfectly.  Though the
   policy does tend to accommodate broken implementations it is held
   to more important to get the communication flowing than to
   immediately (but terminally) diagnose the broken implementations
   at the expense of the people trying to use them.The principle is a well-known one in the design of programs
   that handle Internet wire protocols, especially network
   relays and servers, and it is regularly applied by extension
   in any situation where two or more separately-implemented
   pieces of software are supposed to interoperate even though the
   various implementors have never talked to each other and have
   absolutely nothing whatsoever in common other than having
   all read the same protocol specification.  The principle travels
   under several different names, including <italic>the Internet credo</italic>,
   <italic>the IETF maxim</italic>, <italic>the Internet Engineering
   Principle</italic>, and
   <italic>the liberal/conservative rule</italic>; the [proposed] term
   <italic>Postel' Prescription</italic> is a tribute to its inventor, the first
   RFC editor
   and (until his untimely death) probably the single most respected
   individual in the Internet engineering community.</def>

   Hackers consider PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all time,
   and the combination of technical merits and widespread availability has
   made PostScript the language of choice for graphical output.</def>

    <def> [techspeak] (alt.: <emphasis>punch card</emphasis>)
   The signature medium of computing's <name>Stone Age</name>, now
   obsolescent.  The punched card actually predated computers considerably,
   originating in 1801 as a control device for mechanical looms.  The version
   patented by Hollerith and used with mechanical tabulating machines in the
   1890 U.S. Census was a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm.  There is
   a widespread myth that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used
   for that era's larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have
   falsified this.IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married
   the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of
   small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card.
   Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at various
   times.The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the
   IBM punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed
   with many varieties of computers even today.  See

    <term>quantifiers</term>
    <def> In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric prefixes used in the SI
   (Système International) conventions for scientific measurement have
   dual uses.  With units of time or things that come in powers of 10, such as
   money, they retain their usual meanings of multiplication by powers of
   1000 = 10^3.  But when used with bytes or
   other things that naturally come in powers of 2, they usually denote
   multiplication by powers of 1024 = 2^10.Here are the SI magnifying prefixes, along with the corresponding
   binary interpretations in common use:Here are the SI fractional prefixes:The prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included in
   these tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were adopted in
   1990 by the 19th Conference Generale des Poids et
   Mesures.  The binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well
   established, are not in jargon use either &#8212; yet.  The prefix milli-,
   denoting multiplication by 1/1000, has
   always been rare in jargon (there is, however, a standard joke about the
   <emphasis>millihelen</emphasis> &#8212; notionally, the
   amount of beauty required to launch one ship).  See the entries on
   <name>micro-</name>, <name>pico-</name>, and
   <name>nano-</name> for more information on connotative jargon use
   of these terms.  &#8216;Femto&#8217; and &#8216;atto&#8217; (which,
   interestingly, derive not from Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired
   jargon loadings, though it is easy to predict what those will be once
   computing technology enters the required realms of magnitude (however, see
   <name>attoparsec</name>).There are, of course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of 10.
   In the following table, the &#8216;prefix&#8217; column is the
   international standard prefix for the appropriate power of ten; the
   &#8216;binary&#8217; column lists jargon abbreviations and words for the
   corresponding power of 2.  The B-suffixed forms are commonly used for byte
   quantities; the words &#8216;meg&#8217; and &#8216;gig&#8217; are nouns
   that may (but do not always) pluralize with &#8216;s&#8217;.Confusingly, hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or
   numeric multipliers rather than a prefix; thus <italic>2K dollars</italic>,
   <italic>2M of disk space</italic>.  This is also true (though less commonly)
   of G.Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is &#8216;k&#8217;;
   some use this strictly, reserving &#8216;K&#8217; for multiplication by
   1024 (KB is thus &#8216;kilobytes&#8217;).K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is 64
   gigabytes and &#8216;a K&#8217; is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of
   &#8216;a G&#8217; as short for &#8216;a grand&#8217;, that is, $1000).
   Whether one pronounces &#8216;gig&#8217; with hard or soft &#8216;g&#8217;
   depends on what one thinks the proper pronunciation of &#8216;giga-&#8217;
   is.Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in
   magnitude) &#8212; for example, describing a memory in units of 500K or
   524K instead of 512K &#8212; is a sure sign of the
   <name>marketroid</name>.  One example of this: it is common to
   refer to the capacity of 3.5" floppies as &#8216;1.44 MB&#8217; In
   fact, this is a completely <name>bogus</name> number.  The
   correct size is 1440 KB, that is, 1440 * 1024 = 1474560 bytes.  So the
   &#8216;mega&#8217; in &#8216;1.44 MB&#8217; is compounded of two
   &#8216;kilos&#8217;, one of which is 1024 and the other of which is 1000.
   The correct number of megabytes would of course be 1440 / 1024 = 1.40625.
   Alas, this fine point is probably lost on the world forever.  [1993 update:
   hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general approval on Usenet, the
   following additional prefixes:We observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and
   chico- available for future expansion.  Sadly, there is little immediate
   prospect that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal will be
   ratified.]</def>

    <def> A theory that characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources
   (such as politicians, used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and
   <name>suit</name>s in general), bogon sinks (such as taxpayers
   and computers), and bogosity potential fields.  Bogon absorption, of
   course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and machines to fail (and
   may also cause both to emit secondary bogons); however, the precise
   mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are not yet understood and
   remain to be elucidated.  Quantum bogodynamics is most often invoked to
   explain the sharp increase in hardware and software failures in the
   presence of suits; the latter emit bogons, which the former absorb.  See
   <name>bogon</name>, <name>computron</name>,
   <name>suit</name>, <name>psyton</name>.Here is a representative QBD theory: The bogon is a boson (integral
   spin, +1 or -1), and has zero rest mass.  In this respect it is very much
   like a photon.  However, it has a much greater momentum, thus explaining
   its destructive effect on computer electronics and human nervous systems.
   The corollary to this is that bogons also have tremendous inertia, and
   therefore a bogon beam is deflected only with great difficulty.  When the
   bogon encounters its antiparticle, the cluon, they mutually annihilate each
   other, releasing magic smoke.  Furthermore 1 Lenat = 1 mole (6.022E23) of
   bogons (see <name>microLenat</name>).</def>

    <def> Many older processor architectures suffer from a serious shortage of
   general-purpose registers.  This is especially a problem for
   compiler-writers, because their generated code needs places to store
   temporaries for things like intermediate values in expression evaluation.
   Some designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do have a handful of
   special-purpose registers that can be pressed into service, providing
   suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side effects on the state of the
   processor: while the special-purpose register is being used to hold an
   intermediate value, a delicate minuet is required in which the previous
   value of the register is saved and then restored just before the official
   function (and value) of the special-purpose register is again

    <def> [Request For Comment] One of a long-es­tab­lished series of
   numbered Internet informational documents and standards widely followed by
   commercial software and freeware in the Internet and Unix communities.
   Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet
   mail-format standard).  The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by
   technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by the
   Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an institution
   such as ANSI.  For this reason, they remain known as RFCs even once adopted
   as standards.The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact
   standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has important
   advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process typical of ANSI
   or ISO.  Emblematic of some of these advantages is the existence of a
   flourishing tradition of &#8216;joke&#8217; RFCs; usually at least one a
   year is published, usually on April 1st.  Well-known joke RFCs have
   included 527 (<italic>ARPAWOCKY</italic>, R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973),
   748 (<italic>Telnet Randomly-Lose Option</italic>, Mark R. Crispin; 1 April
   1978), and 1149 (<italic>A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on
   Avian Carriers</italic>, D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April 1990).  The first was
   a Lewis Carroll pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation
   style, and the third a deadpan skewering of standards-document legalese,
   describing protocols for transmitting Internet data packets by carrier
   pigeon (since actually implemented; see Appendix A).  See also
   <name>Infinite-Monkey Theorem</name>.The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work &#8212; they
   frequently manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in
   informal specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that
   often haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to
   truly worldwide proportions.</def>

    <def> 1. [Unix] <emphasis>n.</emphasis> A
   Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game using character graphics, written under BSD
   Unix and subsequently ported to other Unix systems.  The original BSD
   curses3
   screen-handling package was hacked together by Ken Arnold primarily to
   support games, and the development of
   rogue6
   popularized its use; it has since become one of Unix's most important and
   heavily used application libraries.  Nethack, Omega, Larn, Angband, and an
   entire subgenre of computer dungeon games (all known as
   &#8216;roguelikes&#8217;) all took off from the inspiration provided by
   rogue6;
   the popular Windows game Diablo, though graphics-intensive, has very
   similar play logic.  See also <name>nethack</name>,

    <def> [Russian, literally <italic>self publishing</italic>] The process of
   disseminating documentation via underground channels.  Originally referred
   to underground duplication and distribution of banned books in the Soviet
   Union; now refers by obvious extension to any less-than-official
   promulgation of textual material, esp. rare, obsolete, or
   never-formally-published computer documentation.  Samizdat is obviously
   much easier when one has access to high-bandwidth networks and high-quality
   laser printers.  Note that samizdat is properly used only with respect to
   documents which contain needed information (see also 
   <name>hacker ethic</name>) but which are for some reason otherwise unavailable, but
   <emphasis>not</emphasis> in the context of documents which are available
   through normal channels, for which unauthorized duplication would be
   unethical copyright violation.  See <name>Lions Book</name> for a

    <def> A hacker who hires out for legal cracking jobs, snooping for
   factions in corporate political fights, lawyers pursuing privacy-rights and
   First Amendment cases, and other parties with legitimate reasons to need an
   electronic locksmith.  In 1991, mainstream media reported the existence of
   a loose-knit culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS systems,
   mostly bright teenagers with personal micros; they have modeled themselves
   explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the <italic>net
   cowboys</italic> of William Gibson's <name>cyberpunk</name>
   novels.  Those interviewed claim to adhere to a rigid ethic of loyalty to
   their employers and to disdain the vandalism and theft practiced by
   criminal crackers as beneath them and contrary to the hacker ethic; some
   quote Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings, a
   classic of historical samurai doctrine, in support of these principles.

    <def> [from the nuclear power industry] An emergency-power-off switch (see

   volts across himself while <name>Easter egging</name>.  (See also
   <name>molly-guard</name>, <name>TMRC</name>.)<italic>Scram</italic> was in origin a backronym for <italic>Safety Cut
   Rope Axe Man</italic> coined by Enrico Fermi himself.  The story goes that
   in the earliest nuclear power experiments the engineers recognized the
   possibility that the reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their
   mathematical models.  Accordingly, they made sure that they had mechanisms
   in place that would rapidly drop the control rods back into the reactor.
   One mechanism took the form of &#8216;scram technicians&#8217;.  These
   individuals stood next to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered the
   control rods.  Equipped with axes or cable-cutters, these technicians stood
   ready for the (literal) &#8216;scram&#8217; command.  If necessary, they
   would cut the cables, and gravity would expeditiously return the control
   rods to the reactor, thereby averting yet another kind of <name>core
   dump</name>.Modern reactor control rods are held in place with claw-like devices,
   held closed by current.  SCRAM switches are circuit breakers that
   immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the rapid
   insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods.</def>

   replacement for some precious resource or data that might otherwise get
   trashed.This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder Monkey,
   star of a biological research program at the University of Toronto.  Mabel
   was not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey; the university had spent
   years teaching her how to swim, breathing through a regulator, in order to
   study the effects of different gas mixtures on her physiology.  Mabel
   suffered an untimely demise one day when a <name>DEC</name>
   <name>field circus</name> engineer troubleshooting a crash on the
   program's <name>VAX</name> inadvertently interfered with some
   custom hardware that was wired to Mabel.It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate

   troubleshooter called up the <name>field circus</name> manager
   responsible and asked him sweetly, <italic>Can you swim?</italic> Not all the

   question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of certain clueless
   <name>droid</name>s at the local &#8216;humane&#8217; society.
   The moral is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey.  [The
   actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version of this story,
   complete with reported dialogue between one of the project people and DEC
   field service, that has been circulating on Internet since 1986.  It is
   hilarious and mythic, but gets some facts wrong.  For example, it reports
   the machine as a <name>PDP-11</name> and alleges that Mabel's demise occurred when DEC
   <name>PM</name>ed the machine.  Earlier versions of this entry

    <term>security through obscurity</term>
    <def> (alt.: <emphasis>security by obscurity</emphasis>)
   A term applied by hackers to most OS vendors' favorite way of coping with
   security holes &#8212; namely, ignoring them, documenting neither any known
   holes nor the underlying security algorithms, trusting that nobody will
   find out about them and that people who do find out about them won't
   exploit them.  This <italic>strategy</italic> never works for long and
   occasionally sets the world up for debacles like the
   <name>RTM</name> worm of 1988 (see 
   <name>Great Worm</name>), but once the brief moments of panic created by such
   events subside most vendors are all too willing to turn over and go back to
   sleep.  After all, actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources
   needed to implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list
   &#8212; and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers might
   begin to <emphasis>expect</emphasis> it and imagine that their warranties
   of merchantability gave them some sort of <emphasis>right</emphasis> to a
   system with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and
   <emphasis>then</emphasis> where would we be?Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of
   this term.  It has been claimed that it was first used in the Usenet
   newsgroup comp.sys.apollo during
   a campaign to get HP/Apollo to fix security problems in its
   Unix-<name>clone</name> Aegis/DomainOS (they didn't change a
   thing).  <name>ITS</name> fans, on the other hand, say it was
   coined years earlier in opposition to the incredibly paranoid
   <name>Multics</name> people down the hall, for whom security was
   everything.  In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the fact that by the
   time a tourist figured out how to make trouble he'd generally gotten over
   the urge to make it, because he felt part of the community; and (2)
   (self-mockingly) the poor coverage of the documentation and obscurity of
   many commands.  One instance of <emphasis>deliberate</emphasis> security
   through obscurity is recorded; the command to allow patching the running
   ITS system (escape escape control-R) echoed as $$^D.  If you actually typed
   alt alt ^D, that set a flag that would prevent patching the system even if
   you later got it right.</def>

   <name>PDP-11</name> assembler that used the SEX mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for
   once) marketing wasn't asleep and forced a change.  That wasn't the last
   time this happened, either.  The author of The Intel 8086
   Primer, who was one of the original designers of the 8086,
   noted that there was originally a SEX
   instruction on that processor, too.  He says that Intel management got cold
   feet and decreed that it be changed, and thus the instruction was renamed
   CBW and CWD
   (depending on what was being extended).  Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the
   microcontroller used in IBM PC keyboards) is also missing straight SEX but has logical-or and logical-and instructions
   ORL and ANL.The Motorola 6809, used in the Radio Shack Color Computer and in
   U.K.'s &#8216;Dragon 32&#8217; personal computer, actually had an official
   SEX instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II
   with which it competed did not.  British hackers thought this made perfect
   mythic sense; after all, it was commonly observed, you could (on some
   theoretical level) have sex with a dragon, but you can't have sex with an

    <def> [Unix/Internet] The unique electronic name of a computer system,
   used to identify it in email, Usenet, or other forms of electronic
   information interchange.  The folklore interest of sitenames stems from the
   creativity and humor they often display.  Interpreting a sitename is not
   unlike interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack it,
   allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of whitespace.
   Hacker tradition deprecates dull, institutional-sounding names in favor of
   punchy, humorous, and clever coinages (except that it is considered
   appropriate for the official public gateway machine of an organization to
   bear the organization's name or acronym).  Mythological references, cartoon
   characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or fantasy literature are
   probably the most popular sources for sitenames (in roughly descending
   order).  The obligatory comment when discussing these is Harris's Lament:

    <def> 1. A one-sided <name>fudge factor</name>, that is, an

   need a piece of wire 10 feet long and have to guess when you cut it, you
   make very sure to cut it too long, by a large amount if necessary, rather
   than too short by even a little bit, because you can always cut off the
   slop but you can't paste it back on again.  When discrete quantities are
   involved, slop is often introduced to avoid the possibility of being on the
   losing side of a <name>fencepost error</name>.   2. The percentage of &#8216;extra&#8217; code generated by a
   compiler over the size of equivalent assembler code produced by

   lose because you didn't do it yourself.  This number is often used as a
   measure of the goodness of a compiler; slop below 5% is very good, and 10%
   is usually acceptable.  With modern compiler technology, esp. on RISC
   machines, the compiler's slop may actually be
   <emphasis>negative</emphasis>; that is, humans may be unable to generate

    <def> [ITS] A <name>display hack</name> originally due to Bill
   Gosper.  Many convergent lines are drawn on a color monitor in such a way
   that every pixel struck has its color incremented.  The lines all have one
   endpoint in the middle of the screen; the other endpoints are spaced one
   pixel apart around the perimeter of a large square.  The color map is then
   repeatedly rotated.  This results in a striking, rainbow-hued, shimmering
   four-leaf clover.  Gosper joked about keeping it hidden from the FDA (the
   U.S.'s Food and Drug Administration) lest its hallucinogenic properties
   cause it to be banned.</def>

    <def> [MIT] A unit of length equal five feet seven inches.  The length of
   the Harvard Bridge in Boston is famously 364.4 smoots plus an ear (the ear
   is allegedly the width of the earhole in the side of the football helmet
   the victim was wearing when he was rolled over the bridge). This legend
   began with a fraternity prank in 1958 during which the body length of
   Oliver Smoot (class of '62) was actually used to measure out that distance.
   It is commemorated by smoot marks that MIT students repaint every few
   years; the tradition even survived the demolition and rebuilding of the
   bridge in the late 1980s.  The Boston police have been known to use smoot
   markers to indicate accident locations on the bridge.  Apparently Smoot's
   experience as a unit of measurement led to a life-long career; he
   eventually became Chairman of the Board of the American National Standards
   Institute, and later President of the International Organization for
   Standardization.</def>

    <def> Term used to describe the tendency of software that has not been
   used in a while to <name>lose</name>; such failure may be
   semi-humorously ascribed to <name>bit rot</name>.  More commonly,
   <emphasis>software rot</emphasis> strikes when a program's
   assumptions become out of date.  If the design was insufficiently
   <name>robust</name>, this may cause it to fail in mysterious
   ways. Syn. <emphasis>code rot</emphasis>.  See also
   <name>link rot</name>.For example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of COBOL
   programs, a good number of them succumbed to software rot when their
   2-digit year counters underwent <name>wrap around</name> at the
   beginning of the year 2000.  Actually, related lossages often afflict
   centenarians who have to deal with computer software designed by
   unimaginative clods.  One such incident became the focus of a minor public
   flap in 1990, when a gentleman born in 1889 applied for a driver's license
   renewal in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The new system refused to issue the
   card, probably because with 2-digit years the ages 101 and 1 cannot be
   distinguished.Historical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the
   mythical one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g., the R1;
   see <name>grind crank</name>).  If a program that depended on a
   peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user might
   discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they once did.
   (<italic>Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do such-and-such.  We can
   snarf this opcode, right?  No one uses it.</italic>)
   Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker found a
   simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump instruction on a
   PDP-6, so he patched the hardware.  Unfortunately, this broke some fragile
   timing software in a music-playing program, throwing its output out of
   tune.  This was fixed by adding a defensive initialization routine to
   compare the speed of a timing loop with the real-time clock; in other
   words, it figured out how fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected
   appropriately.Compare <name>bit rot</name>.</def>

    </abbrev>
    <def> A now-legendary device used on MIT LISP machines, which inspired
   several still-current jargon terms and influenced the design of
   <name>EMACS</name>.  It was equipped with no fewer than
   <emphasis>seven</emphasis> shift keys: four keys for <name>bucky
   bits</name> (&#8216;control&#8217;, &#8216;meta&#8217;,
   &#8216;hyper&#8217;, and &#8216;super&#8217;) and three regular shift keys,
   called &#8216;shift&#8217;, &#8216;top&#8217;, and &#8216;front&#8217;.
   Many keys had three symbols on them: a letter and a symbol on the top, and
   a Greek letter on the front.  For example, the &#8216;L&#8217; key had an
   &#8216;L&#8217; and a two-way arrow on the top, and the Greek letter lambda
   on the front.  By pressing this key with the right hand while playing an
   appropriate &#8216;chord&#8217; with the left hand on the shift keys, you
   could get the following results:And of course each of these might also be typed with any combination
   of the control, meta, hyper, and super keys.  On this keyboard, you could
   type over 8000 different characters!  This allowed the user to type very
   complicated mathematical text, and also to have thousands of
   single-character commands at his disposal.  The keyboard of the Symbolics
   Lisp machine was a simplified version, lacking Top and Front keys, that
   could only send about 2000 characters.Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the command meanings
   of that many characters if it reduced typing time (this attitude obviously
   shaped the interface of EMACS).  Other hackers, however, thought having
   that many bucky bits was overkill, and objected that such a keyboard can
   require three or four hands to operate.  See <name>bucky
   bits</name>, <name>cokebottle</name>, <name>double
   bucky</name>, <name>meta bit</name>, <name>quadruple
   bucky</name>.(Some relatively bad photographs of the earlier, more elaborate
   version are available on
   the Web.).Note: early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the
   space-cadet keyboard with the <emphasis>Knight
   keyboard</emphasis>.  Though both were designed by Tom Knight, the latter
   term was properly applied only to a keyboard used for ITS on the PDP-10 and
   modeled on the Stanford keyboard (as described under <name>bucky

   Knight keyboard.</def>

    <def> [from Monty Python's Flying Circus]  1. To crash a program by overrunning a fixed-size buffer with
   excessively large input data.  See also 
   <name>buffer overflow</name>, <name>overrun screw</name>,
   <name>smash the stack</name>.   2. To cause a newsgroup to be flooded with irrelevant or
   inappropriate messages. You can spam a newsgroup with as little as one
   well- (or ill-) planned message (e.g. asking <italic>What do you think of
   abortion?</italic> on soc.women).
   This is often done with <name>cross-post</name>ing (e.g. any
   message which is cross-posted to alt.rush-limbaugh and alt.politics.homosexuality will almost
   inevitably spam both groups). This overlaps with
   <name>troll</name> behavior; the latter more specific term has
   become more common.  3. To send many identical or nearly-identical messages separately to
   a large number of Usenet newsgroups. This is more specifically called
   <emphasis>ECP</emphasis>, Excessive Cross-Posting.  This
   is one sure way to infuriate nearly everyone on the Net. See also
   <name>velveeta</name> and <name>jello</name>. 4. To bombard a newsgroup with multiple copies of a message.  This
   is more specifically called <emphasis>EMP</emphasis>,
   Excessive Multi-Posting.   5.  To mass-mail unrequested identical or nearly-identical email
   messages, particularly those containing advertising.  Especially used when
   the mail addresses have been culled from network traffic or databases
   without the consent of the recipients. Synonyms include
   <name>UCE</name>, <name>UBE</name>.
   As a noun, &#8216;spam&#8217; refers to the messages so sent. 6. Any large, annoying, quantity of output.  For instance, someone
   on IRC who walks away from their screen and comes back to find 200 lines of
   text might say <italic>Oh no, spam</italic>.The later definitions have become much more prevalent as the Internet
   has opened up to non-techies, and to most people senses 3 4 and 5 are now
   primary.  All three behaviors are considered abuse of the net, and are
   almost universally grounds for termination of the originator's email
   account or network connection.  In these senses the term &#8216;spam&#8217;
   has gone mainstream, though without its original sense or folkloric freight
   &#8212; there is apparently a widespread myth among

   individual humans reading an email message can readily spot and remove a
   spamblock in the From address.Note: This is not actually a very effective tactic, and may already
   be passing out of use in early 1999 after about two years of life.  In both
   mail and news, it's essentially impossible to keep a smart address
   harvester from mining out the addresses in the message header and trace

    <def> [Unix] A special case of a <name>filter</name> that reads
   its entire input before writing any output; the canonical example is a sort
   utility.  Unlike most filters, a sponge can conveniently overwrite the
   input file with the output data stream.  If a file system has versioning
   (as ITS did and VMS does now) the sponge/filter distinction loses its
   usefulness, because directing filter output would just write a new version.

   1920s.Most of these are not used at universities or in the Unix
   world, though ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is
   common; conversely, most of the people who know these are unfamiliar with
   FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP, <name>NIL</name>, and
   <name>T</name>.The <name>MUD</name> community uses a mixture of
   Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more natural of the old-style
   talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the &#8216;social&#8217; list above;
   specifically, MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF,
   TTFN, and WTH.  The use of <emphasis>rehi</emphasis> is
   also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re- compounds and will frequently
   <emphasis>rehug</emphasis> or <emphasis>rebonk</emphasis> (see <name>bonk/oif</name>)
   people.  The word <emphasis>re</emphasis> by itself is
   taken as &#8216;regreet&#8217;.  In general, though, MUDders express a
   preference for typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations;
   this may be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to
   include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links.  The following
   uses specific to MUDs are reported:Some <name>B1FF</name>isms (notably the variant spelling
   d00d) appear to be passing into wider use
   among some subgroups of MUDders.One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode,
   often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because they are
   typing rather than speaking.  This is not the best approach.  It can be
   very frustrating to wait while your partner pauses to think of a word, or
   repeatedly makes the same spelling error and backs up to fix it.  It is
   usually best just to leave typographical errors behind and plunge forward,
   unless severe confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just
   to type <italic>xxx</italic> and start over from before the mistake.See also <name>hakspek</name>,

   he would finish it on his sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8
   years.  The language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of
   The Art of Computer Programming is not expected to
   appear until 2007.  The impact and influence of TeX's design has been such
   that nobody minds this very much.  Many grand hackish projects have started
   as a bit of <name>toolsmith</name>ing on the way to something
   else; Knuth's diversion was simply on a grander scale than most.TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but
   high-quality software.  Knuth offers a monetary award to anyone who found
   and reported bugs dating from before the 1989 code freeze; as the years
   wore on and the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to
   find), the bribe went up.  Though well-written, TeX is so large (and so
   full of cutting edge technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least
   one bug in every Pascal system it has been compiled with.</def>

    <def> 1. [obs.]<italic>A piece of coding which provides an
   address:</italic>, according to P. Z. Ingerman, who invented thunks in 1961
   as a way of binding actual parameters to their formal definitions in
   Algol-60 procedure calls.  If a procedure is called with an expression in
   the place of a formal parameter, the compiler generates a thunk which
   computes the expression and leaves the address of the result in some
   standard location.   2. Later generalized into: an expression, frozen together with its
   environment, for later evaluation if and when needed (similar to what in
   techspeak is called a <emphasis>closure</emphasis>).  The
   process of unfreezing these thunks is called <emphasis>forcing</emphasis>.   3. A <name>stubroutine</name>, in an overlay programming
   environment, that loads and jumps to the correct overlay.  Compare
   <name>trampoline</name>.4.  Microsoft and IBM have both defined, in their Intel-based
   systems, a <italic>16-bit environment</italic> (with bletcherous segment
   registers and 64K address limits) and a <italic>32-bit environment</italic>
   (with flat addressing and semi-real memory management). The two
   environments can both be running on the same computer and OS (thanks to
   what is called, in the Microsoft world, WOW which stands for Windows On
   Windows). MS and IBM have both decided that the process of getting from 16-
   to 32-bit and vice versa is called a <italic>thunk</italic>; for Windows 95,
   there is even a tool THUNK.EXE called a <italic>thunk compiler</italic>.
    5. A person or activity scheduled in a thunklike manner.  <italic>It

   about the origin of this term.  The most common is that it is the sound
   made by data hitting the stack; another holds that the sound is that of the
   data hitting an accumulator.  Yet another suggests that it is the sound of
   the expression being unfrozen at argument-evaluation time.  In fact,
   according to the inventors, it was coined after they realized (in the wee
   hours after hours of discussion) that the type of an argument in Algol-60
   could be figured out in advance with a little compile-time thought,
   simplifying the evaluation machinery.  In other words, it had
   &#8216;already been thought of&#8217;; thus it was christened a <emphasis>thunk</emphasis>, which is <italic>the past tense of

    <term>timesharing</term>
    <def>[now primarily historical] Timesharing is the technique of scheduling
   a computer's time so that they are shared across multiple tasks and
   multiple users, with each user having the illusion that his or her
   computation is going on continuously.  John McCarthy, the inventor of
   <name>LISP</name>, first imagined
   this technique in the late 1950s.  The first timesharing operating
   systems, BBN's "Little Hospital" and <name>CTSS</name>, were
   deplayed in 1962-63.  The early hacker culture of the 1960s and 1970s grew
   up around the first generation of relatively cheap timesharing computers,
   notably the <name>DEC</name> 10, 11, and <name>VAX</name> lines.  But these
   were only cheap in a relative sense; though quite a bit less powerful than
   today's personal computers, they had to be shared by dozens or even
   hundreds of people each.  The early hacker comunities nucleated around
   places where it was relatively easy to get access to a timesharing
   account.Nowadays, communications bandwidth is usually the most important 
   constraint on what you can do with your computer.  Not so back then;
   timesharing machines were often loaded to capacity, and it was not uncommon 
   for everyone's work to grind to a halt while the machine scheduler
   thrashed, trying to figure out what to do next.  Early hacker slang
   was replete with terms like <emphasis>cycle
   crunch</emphasis> and <emphasis>cycle drought</emphasis>
   for describing the consequences of too few instructions-per-second spread
   among too many users.  As GLS has noted, this sort of problem influenced
   the tendency of many hackers to work odd schedules.One reason this is worth noting here is to make the point that the
   earliest hacker communities were physical, not distributed via networks;
   they consisted of hackers who shared a machine and therefore had to deal
   with many of the same problems with respect to it.  A system crash could
   idle dozens of eager programmers, all sitting in the same terminal room and
   with little to do but talk with each other until normal operation
   resumed.Timesharing moved from being the luxury of a few large universities
   runing semi-experimental operating systems to being more generally
   available about 1975-76. Hackers in search of more cycles and more control
   over their programming environment began to migrate off timesharing
   machines and onto what are now called <emphasis>workstations</emphasis> around 1983.  It took another ten
   years, the development of powerful 32-bit personal micros, the
   <name>Great Internet Explosion</name> before the migration was
   complete.  It is no coincidence that the last stages of this migration
   coincided with the development of the first open-source operating
   systems.</def>

   terminology is infested.   2. Any confusing acronym.  Examples include MCA, FTP, SNA, CPU, MMU,
   SCCS, DMU, FPU, NNTP, TLA.  People who like this looser usage argue that
   not all TLAs have three letters, just as not all four-letter words have
   four letters.  One also hears of &#8216;ETLA&#8217; (Extended Three-Letter
   Acronym, pronounced <emphasis>/ee tee el

    <def> The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one of the wellsprings of
   hacker culture.  The 1959 Dictionary of the TMRC
   Language compiled by Peter Samson included several terms that
   became basics of the hackish vocabulary (see
   esp. <name>foo</name>, <name>mung</name>, and
   <name>frob</name>).By 1962, TMRC's legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity
   and has grown in the years since. All the features described here were
   still present when the old layout was decommissioned in 1998 just before
   the demolition of MIT Building 20, and will almost certainly be retained
   when the old layout is rebuilt (expected in 2003).  The control system
   alone featured about 1200 relays.  There were <name>scram
   switch</name>es located at numerous places around the room that could
   be thwacked if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train
   going full-bore at an obstruction.  Another feature of the system was a
   digital clock on the dispatch board, which was itself something of a wonder
   in those bygone days before cheap LEDs and seven-segment displays.  When
   someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced
   with the word &#8216;FOO&#8217;; at TMRC the scram switches are therefore
   called <emphasis>foo switches</emphasis>.Steven Levy, in his book Hackers (see the
   Bibliography in Appendix C), gives a
   stimulating account of those early years.  TMRC's Signals and Power
   Committee included many of the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who later
   became the core of the MIT AI Lab staff.  Thirty years later that
   connection is still very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly includes
   a number of entries from a recent revision of the TMRC dictionary.TMRC has a web page at http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/.  The TMRC
   Dictionary is available there, at http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/dictionary.html.</def>

    <def> Term used on GEnie, Usenet and other electronic fora to describe the

   subject of discussion (and thus, from the Subject header of the originating
   message), or the results of that tendency.  The header in each post can be
   changed to keep current with the posts, but usually isn't due to
   forgetfulness or laziness.  A single post may often result in several posts
   each responding to a different point in the original.  Some subthreads will
   actually be in response to some off-the-cuff side comment, possibly
   degenerating into a <name>flame war</name>, or just as often
   evolving into a separate discussion.  Hence, discussions aren't really so
   much threads as they are trees.  Except that they don't really have leaves,
   or multiple branching roots; usually some lines of discussion will just
   sort of die off after everyone gets tired of them.  This could take
   anywhere from hours to weeks, or even longer.The term &#8216;topic drift&#8217; is often used in gentle reminders
   that the discussion has strayed off any useful track.  <italic>I think we

   more than one concurrent process that could generate tumblers
   it must also include an encoding of the process ID.  If tumblers will be
   shared across multiple network hosts, they must also include the host name
   or network address. Tumblers often include a hash of the rest of the
   message or record content so that it is possible to verify the 
   correctness of the data the tumbler is attached to.2. Variant text added to spam instances (often in the Subject line) to
   make them unique.  This kind of tumbler is used to defeat schemes that
   check an exact hash of an incoming message against known spam signatures;

    <def> The TOPS-20 operating system by <name>DEC</name> &#8212;
   the second proprietary OS for the PDP-10 &#8212; preferred by most PDP-10
   hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not
   <name>ITS</name> or <name>WAITS</name> partisans).
   TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman's TENEX operating
   system using special paging hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of
   the systems on the ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX
   from BBN and began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name
   for the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when
   customers started asking questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC
   could truthfully deny that there was any project called VIROS.  When the
   name SNARK became known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS;
   this was quickly abandoned when someone objected that <emphasis>krans</emphasis> meant &#8216;funeral wreath&#8217; in
   Swedish (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply
   &#8216;wreath&#8217;; this part of the story may be apocryphal).
   Ultimately DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it
   was as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of its
   origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of &#8216;twenty
   TENEX&#8217;), even though by this point very little of the original TENEX

   term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation &#8216;20x&#8217; was
   also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact, there was a
   period in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of
   partisans as Unix or ITS &#8212; but DEC's decision to scrap all the
   internal rivals to the <name>VAX</name> architecture and its
   relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's
   brief day in the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 users to convert
   to <name>VMS</name>, but instead, by the late 1980s, most of the
   TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix.  There is a TOPS-20 home page.</def>

    <def> [In the authors' words, <italic>A weak pun on Multics</italic>; very

   interactive timesharing system invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell
   Labs left the Multics project, originally so he could play games on his
   scavenged PDP-7.  Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a
   co-author of the system.  The turning point in Unix's history came when it
   was reimplemented almost entirely in C during 1972&#8212;1974, making it
   the first source-portable OS.  Unix subsequently underwent mutations and
   expansions at the hands of many different people, resulting in a uniquely
   flexible and developer-friendly environment.  By 1991, Unix had become the
   most widely used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world
   &#8212; and since 1996 the variant called <name>Linux</name> has
   been at the cutting edge of the <name>open source</name>
   movement.  Many people consider the success of Unix the most important
   victory yet of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see <name>Unix
   weenie</name> and <name>Unix conspiracy</name> for an
   opposing point of view).  See <name>Version 7</name>,
   <name>BSD</name>, <name>Linux</name>.Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately
   &#8216;UNIX&#8217; or &#8216;Unix&#8217;; both forms are common, and used
   interchangeably.  Dennis Ritchie says that the &#8216;UNIX&#8217; spelling
   originally happened in CACM's 1974 paper The UNIX Time-Sharing
   System because <italic>we had a new typesetter and
   troff had just been invented and we were intoxicated
   by being able to produce small caps.</italic> Later, dmr tried to get the
   spelling changed to &#8216;Unix&#8217; in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on
   the grounds that the word is not acronymic.  He failed, and eventually (his
   words) <italic>wimped out</italic> on the issue.  So, while the trademark
   today is &#8216;UNIX&#8217;, both capitalizations are grounded in ancient
   usage; the Jargon File uses &#8216;Unix&#8217; in deference to dmr's

    <def> [ITS] According to a conspiracy theory long popular among
   <name>ITS</name> and <name>TOPS-20</name> fans, Unix's
   growth is the result of a plot, hatched during the 1970s at Bell Labs,
   whose intent was to hobble AT&amp;T's competitors by making them dependent
   upon a system whose future evolution was to be under AT&amp;T's control.
   This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system that is
   apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively unreliable
   and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from AT&amp;T).  This
   theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper referenced in
   the <name>back door</name> entry.In this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer
   viruses (see <name>virus</name>) &#8212; but a virus spread to
   computers indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly
   through disks and networks.  Adherents of this &#8216;Unix virus&#8217;
   theory like to cite the fact that the well-known quotation <italic>Unix is
   snake oil</italic> was uttered by <name>DEC</name> president
   Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC began actively promoting its own family of
   Unix workstations.  (Olsen now claims to have been misquoted.)If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
   plotters' control after 1990.  AT&amp;T sold its Unix operation to Novell
   around the same time <name>Linux</name> and other free-Unix
   distributions were beginning to make noise.</def>

   asks silly questions.  [GLS observes: This is slightly unfair.  It is true
   that users ask questions (of necessity).  Sometimes they are thoughtful or
   deep.  Very often they are annoying or downright stupid, apparently because
   the user failed to think for two seconds or look in the documentation
   before bothering the maintainer.]  See <name>luser</name>. 3. Someone who uses a program from the outside, however skillfully,
   without getting into the internals of the program.  One who reports bugs
   instead of just going ahead and fixing them.The general theory behind this term is that there are two classes of
   people who work with a program: there are implementors (hackers) and
   <name>luser</name>s.  The users are looked down on by hackers to
   some extent because they don't understand the full ramifications of the
   system in all its glory.  (The few users who do are known as <emphasis>real winners</emphasis>.)  The term is a relative one: a
   skilled hacker may be a user with respect to some program he himself does
   not hack.  A LISP hacker might be one who maintains LISP or one who uses
   LISP (but with the skill of a hacker).  A LISP user is one who uses LISP,
   whether skillfully or not.  Thus there is some overlap between the two
   terms; the subtle distinctions must be resolved by context.</def>

    <def>This object is historically one of the first complex 3D models to be

   generated by Martin Newell in 1974 using hand-drawn Bezier curves, based on
   a real teapot that he and his wife had bought. This model served as a basis
   for comparing various 3D rendering methodologies for lighting, textures,
   bump-mapping, etc. By the standards of 2002, the model is trivial to render
   and thus is often not suited to demonstrate the complexity of modern
   research.  Despite this, the tea pot still appears, now and then, in recent

   actually entered a cross-licensing deal with the vacuum-Vax people that
   allowed them to market VAX computers in the U.K. in return for not
   challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in the U.S.A rival brand actually pioneered the slogan: its original form was

   classic example (used in advertising textbooks) of the perils of not
   knowing the local idiom.  But in 1996, the press manager of Electrolux AB,

   tells us that their marketing people were fully aware of the possible
   double entendre and intended it to gain attention.And gain attention it did &#8212; the VAX-vacuum-cleaner people
   thought the slogan a sufficiently good idea to copy it.  Several British
   hackers report that VAX's promotions used it in 1986--1987, and we have one

   Usually, however, after propagating silently for a while, it starts doing

   can be annoying but most hackers remember that they, too, were once such

   is trying to cuddle up to the hacker mystique but doesn't, fundamentally,
   have a prayer of understanding what it is all about.  Overuse of terms from
   this lexicon is often an indication of the <name>wannabee</name>
   nature.  Compare <name>newbie</name>.Historical note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different
   flavor now (1993) than it did ten or fifteen years ago.  When the people
   who are now hackerdom's tribal elders were in <name>larval

   and unaffected by models known in popular culture &#8212; communities

   what wannabees experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to
   become similarly wizardly.  Those days of innocence are gone forever;
   society's adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980 included
   the elevation of the hacker as a new kind of folk hero, and the result is
   that some people semi-consciously set out to <emphasis>be
   hackers</emphasis> and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the popular image
   of hackers.  Fortunately, to do this really well, one has to actually
   become a wizard.  Nevertheless, old-time hackers tend to share a poorly

    <term>Whorfian mind-lock</term>
    <def>[from the Lojban-language list] Software designs are often restricted
   in unavoidable ways by the capacities of the operating system or hardware
   they have to work with.  Sometimes they are restricted in avoidable ways by
   mental habits a developer has picked up from a particular language or
   environment (perhaps a now-obsolete one) and never discarded.  When a
   design develops complications that are the result of a mental habit that is
   no longer adaptive, the developer has succumbed to Whorfian mind-lock. The
   design itself has been &#8216;whorfed&#8217;.For example, some Unix designs are whorfed by the assumption that
   directory searches are linear and expensive for large directories;
   therefore directories must be kept small.  Another common way to succumb to
   Whorfian mind-lock is to do serial processing with a small working set
   rather than slurping an entire file or data structure into memory; the
   hidden assumption here is that not much core is available and virtual
   memory works poorly if at all.  Detecting Whorfian mind-lock is important,
   because it tends to introduce unnecessary complexity and bugs.</def>

    <def> The central monster (and, in many versions, the name) of a famous
   family of very early computer games called Hunt The
   Wumpus.  The original was invented in 1970 (several years
   before <name>ADVENT</name>) by Gregory Yob.  The wumpus lived
   somewhere in a cave with the topology of an dodecahedron's edge/vertex
   graph (later versions supported other topologies, including an icosahedron
   and Möbius strip). The player started somewhere at random in the cave
   with five &#8216;crooked arrows&#8217;; these could be shot through up to
   three connected rooms, and would kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions
   introduced the wounded wumpus, which got very angry).  Unfortunately for
   players, the movement necessary to map the maze was made hazardous not
   merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if you stepped on him) but also
   by bottomless pits and colonies of super bats that would pick you up and
   drop you at a random location (later versions added &#8216;anaerobic
   termites&#8217; that ate arrows, bat migrations, and earthquakes that
   randomly changed pit locations).This game appears to have been the first to use a non-random
   graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the even older
   Star Trek games).  In this respect, as in the dungeon-like setting and its
   terse, amusing messages, it prefigured <name>ADVENT</name> and
   <name>Zork</name> and was directly ancestral to the latter (Zork
   acknowledged this heritage by including a super-bat colony).  A C emulation

   &#8216;point-and-shoot&#8217;-style interfaces tend to have easy initial

   users who would be better served by a command-style interface.  When this
   happens, the frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem.  This term is most
   often used of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs.
   WYSIWYG &#8216;desktop publishing&#8217; programs, for example, are a clear
   win for creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them,
   especially things like newsletters and presentation slides.  When
   typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale changes the
   nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG limitations, and the
   increased power and flexibility of a command-driven formatter like

    <def> [from the ADVENT game] The <name>canonical</name>
   &#8216;magic word&#8217;.  This comes from <name>ADVENT</name>,
   in which the idea is to explore an underground cave with many rooms and to
   collect the treasures you find there.  If you type <emphasis>xyzzy</emphasis> at the appropriate time, you can move
   instantly between two otherwise distant points.  If, therefore, you
   encounter some bit of <name>magic</name>, you might remark on
   this quite succinctly by saying simply <italic>Xyzzy!</italic>
   <italic>Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has
   protected it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you
   do it anyway.</italic> <italic>Xyzzy!</italic> It's traditional for xyzzy to
   be an <name>Easter egg</name> in games with text
   interfaces.Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command
   on several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically
   respond <italic>Nothing happens</italic>, just as
   <name>ADVENT</name> did if the magic was invoked at the wrong
   spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the word.  In
   more recent 32-bit versions, by the way, AOS/VS responds <italic>Twice as
   much happens</italic>.Early versions of the popular &#8216;minesweeper&#8217; game under
   Microsoft Windows had a cheat mode triggered by the command
   &#8216;xyzzy&lt;enter&gt;&lt;right-shift&gt;&#8217; that turns the top-left
   pixel of the screen different colors depending on whether or not the cursor
   is over a bomb.  This feature temporarily disappeared in Windows 98, but
   reappeared in Windows 2000.The following passage from The Wonderful Wizard of
   Oz by L. Frank Baum, suggesting a possible pre-ADVENT origin,
   has recently come to light: <italic>Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!</italic> said
   Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.  This ended the saying of the
   charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band
   of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.The text can be viewed at

    <def> <italic>Allow none of foo, one of

   which instructs one to not place <name>random</name> limits on
   the number of instances of a given entity (such as: windows in a window
   system, letters in an OS's filenames, etc.).  Specifically, one should
   either disallow the entity entirely, allow exactly one instance (an
   <italic>exception</italic>), or allow as many as the user wants &#8212;
   address space and memory permitting.The logic behind this rule is that there are often situations where
   it makes clear sense to allow one of something instead of none.  However,
   if one decides to go further and allow N (for N &gt; 1), then why not N+1?
   And if N+1, then why not N+2, and so on?  Once above 1, there's no excuse
   not to allow any N; hence, <name>infinity</name>.Many hackers recall in this connection Isaac Asimov's SF novel
   The Gods Themselves in which a character announces

    <def> First.  Among software designers, comes from C's and LISP's 0-based
   indexing of arrays.  Hardware people also tend to start counting at 0

   correspond to the binary numbers 0, 1, ..., 255 and the digital
   devices known as <emphasis>counters</emphasis> count in
   this way.Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first chapter
